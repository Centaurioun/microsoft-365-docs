# Import or export People Skills

You can import skills for a user from third-party platforms and export a user's confirmed skills using the Microsoft Graph API. Also, you can export a user's confirmed skills.

## Import user skills

You can import user skills from third party systems. The imported skills display on that user's skills profile as *Imported by your organization* and can be confirmed by a user. Once confirmed, imported skills behave the same as all confirmed skills.

User skills from external systems can be imported as an attribute while uploading organizational data into Microsoft 365.

Review the below guideline on how you can use the tool to import user skills:

1. Open the [Organization data ingestion tool ](/viva/import-orgdata)in the admin center and download the .csv template. In the admin center, clickÂ **Setup** > **Migration and imports**.

2. In the organization data ingestion tool template, list all the users for whom you need skills to be imported, and list each user's skills under the attribute **Microsoft_UserSkillNames**. For more information, see [organization data field in the template](/viva/orgdata-attributes).

3. Make a copy of all the user skills and add them to People Skills library as custom skills. For more information, see [how to add custom skills](people-skills-manage-custom-skill.md).

4. Import the user skills data into Microsoft 365 using the .csv upload.

## Export user skills

Admins can export a user's confirmed skills by using the Profile endpoint in the Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [List skills](/graph/api/profile-list-skills?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) about the skills endpoint and specific GET requests to access this data from the Graph API.

> [!NOTE]
> Only a user's confirmed skills can be exported. AI-generated skills can't be exported.
