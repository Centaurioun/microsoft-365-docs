# Manage Custom Skills

If you didn't import custom skills as a part of your initial setup, you can add it later by following the guide below. You can also delete or export custom skills.



### View your custom skills (if custom skills were set up during initial setup)

1.      Under **Skills,** select **People Skills Library,** and then select **Custom skills**. You can filter by role and search by skill name.

2.      Select **View details** to see an overview of your imported files, who completed the import, and the import date.

### Import custom skills library

Follow these steps to either import your custom skills library for the first time or to reimport with changes to your initial custom import.



To import customs skills into Skills:

1. Under **Skills,** select the **Import custom skills** tab

2.      Select **Download library template** and **Download mapping template.**

3.      Open the template files you downloaded. Follow the steps in [Create the custom skills files](/viva/skills/skills-get-started) to create your skills library and skills mapping files.

4.      Paste the file paths for both files into the **Skills library file path** and **Skill mapping file path** fields.

5.      Select **Next** to begin file validation. If there's a problem with the file, you see an error message at this step.

 



6.      Review your custom skills data.

- The number of skills from the out-of-the-box library.

- The number of skills and number of roles/job titles from your custom import.

- The number of duplicate skills identified in your selection. If you have duplicates, your organization's custom data is prioritized over data from the out-of-the-box library.

7.    Acknowledge that importing custom skills will immediately impact your users' experience if skills is turned on.

8.      Select **Confirm** to import.



### Export your skills library

You can export the custom skills that you've set up in your skills library.

1.      Under **Skills,** select **Export library**.

2.      Select **Export custom skills** to export your custom skills import files.

 



### Delete custom skills

Deleting custom skills immediately removes all of these skills from user experiences and deletes all data associated with those skills.

1.      Under **Skills,** select **People Skills Library**, and then select **Custom skills**.

2.      Select **Delete custom skills**.

3.      Select **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete your custom skills.
