      - question: What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Microsoft Search?
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is designed as an AI-powered, enterprise-grade search assistant. It understands semantics of the user intent, considers user context and relationships, learns from user behaviors to deliver personalized, relevant results. It goes beyond keyword matching to interpret intent and provide AI-generated answers with references and follow-up options. [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search), by contrast, is a more traditional search experience. It relies on keyword-based queries and returns a list of links or documents. While it integrates with Microsoft 365, it doesn't integrate in a single result information from all available data sources, like Team, emails, calendar, etc. Both Copilot Search and Microsoft Search adhere to the same data protection, privacy standards, and security configurations. Learn more at [How is Microsoft 365 Copilot Search different from Microsoft Search?](microsoft-365-copilot-search.md#how-is-microsoft-365-copilot-search-different-from-microsoft-search).
      - question: Can a user licensed with Microsoft 365 Copilot still use Microsoft Search? 
        answer: A user level toggle is available on Microsoft 365 Copilot Search experience. By default, this is ON which enables Microsoft 365 Copilot Search experience. However, in situations where users want to revert to the Microsoft Search Experience, they can turn the toggle OFF. The toggle is specific to the application and endpoint and won't persist across web, desktop and mobile. The toggle will be removed after 60 days of Microsoft 365 Copilot Search general availability.
      - question: What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Copilot Search in Bing?     
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is an AI-powered universal search experience optimized for work and school.

It helps you quickly find relevant results from your organization, searching across all your Microsoft 365 apps and any third-party apps integrated via Microsoft Graph connectors.

  - name: Data handling, privacy, and security
    questions:
      - question: Does Microsoft 365 Copilot Search follow the same data, privacy, and security commitments as Microsoft 365 Copilot? 
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is compliant with our existing privacy, security, and compliance commitments to Microsoft 365 commercial customers, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and European Union (EU) Data Boundary. For additional information refer to [Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy).
      - question: What information does Microsoft 365 Copilot Search have access to? 
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot accesses and reasons over the data you already have permission to see within your Microsoft 365 environment. This includes Microsoft Graph (Emails, chats, calendar events, files in OneDrive and SharePoint, meetings), Microsoft 365 apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, Loop), Third-party systems (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Confluence, etc. via [Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-copilot-connector)), and web content. Copilot only returns information that the user already has access to—respecting existing permissions and security boundaries. 
      - question: How can I manage what information Microsoft 365 Copilot Search can find? 
        answer: With Restricted Content Discovery, organizations can limit the ability of end users to search for files from specific SharePoint sites. Enabling Restricted Content Discovery for each site prevents the sites from surfacing in organization-wide search and Microsoft 365 Copilot Business Chat, unless a user had a recent interaction. Learn more at [Restrict discovery of SharePoint sites and content](/sharepoint/restricted-content-discovery). In addition, Restricted SharePoint Search is a setting that helps you as a [SharePoint Administrator](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) or [above](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in Microsoft 365 to maintain a list of SharePoint sites ("allowed list") that you have checked the permissions and applied data governance for. The allowed list defines which SharePoint sites can participate in organization-wide search and Copilot experiences. By default, the Restricted SharePoint Search setting is turned off and the allowed list is empty. Restricted SharePoint Search allows you to restrict both organization-wide search and Copilot experiences to a curated set of SharePoint sites of your choice. Additionally, whether you have enabled Restricted SharePoint Search, users in your organization are still able to interact with files and content they own or that they have previously accessed in Copilot. Learn more at [Restricted SharePoint Search](/sharepoint/restricted-sharepoint-search).
