      - question: What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Microsoft Search?
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is designed as an AI-powered, enterprise-grade search assistant. It understands semantics of the user intent, considers user context and relationships, learns from user behaviors to deliver personalized, relevant results. It goes beyond keyword matching to interpret intent and provide AI-generated answers with references and follow-up options. [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search), by contrast, is a more traditional search experience. It relies on keyword-based queries and returns a list of links or documents. While it integrates with Microsoft 365, it doesn't integrate in a single result information from all available data sources, like Team, emails, calendar, etc. Both Copilot Search and Microsoft Search adhere to the same data protection, privacy standards, and security configurations.
      - question: Can a user licensed with Microsoft 365 Copilot still use Microsoft Search? 
        answer: A user level toggle is available on Microsoft 365 Copilot Search experience. By default, this is ON which enables Microsoft 365 Copilot Search experience. However, in situations where users want to revert to the Microsoft Search Experience, they can turn the toggle OFF. The toggle is specific to the application and endpoint and won't persist across web, desktop and mobile. The toggle will be removed after 60 days of Microsoft 365 Copilot Search general availability.
      - question: What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Copilot Search in Bing?     
        answer: Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is an AI-powered universal search experience optimized for work and school.

It helps you quickly find relevant results from your organization, searching across all your Microsoft 365 apps and any third-party apps integrated via Microsoft Graph connectors. It also adheres to the same data protection, privacy standards, and security configurations as Microsoft 365 Copilot. [Copilot Search in Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/bing/copilot-search/), by contrast, is an AI-powered search engine designed for searching the web. It's intended for individual users who aren't necessarily using it for work or school. It's accessed through a web browser and doesn't require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.
