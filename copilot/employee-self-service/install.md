# Install the Employee Self-Service agent

>[!NOTE]
>The Employee Self-Service agent is currently in limited public preview. Deployment processes are subject to change before this product becomes generally available.

After completing the required steps in the [preparation](prepare.md) stage, you can install the Employee Self-Service (ESS) agent in a specific Power Platform environment.

## Activities summary

|Role |Activities to perform |Configuration area |

## Select the right environment

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) as an assigned Environment Administrator.
1. Before installing the agent, make sure that the correct Power Platform environment is selected by verifying the name in the ribbon.

## Set up a preferred solution

1. Set up a preferred solution before performing any customizations, as the default solution contains all the core components of Dataverse, which can't be exported or imported into another environment.
1. Based on the application lifecycle management guidelines, create a new unmanaged solution in the Dev. environment so the customizations can be performed and exported as managed solution to a Test/UAT/PROD environment.
1. Select **Solutions** in the left navigation pane.
1. Select **+New solution** and fill in the required information.
1. Provide publisher information. Make sure to provide the prefix value, which is used to create objects for this solution prefixed with the given string. For example, if your prefix is "contoso," a new object might be named "contoso_Object".
1. Select **Create** to finish creating the solution.
1. Select **Back to solutions** in the left navigation pane.
1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) and choose **Set preferred solution** for the new solution that you created.

## Install the ESS agent

1. Go to the Copilot Studio home page.
1. Select **Create** in the navigation pane. This should show the **Employee Self-Service** agent on the **Explore agents** page.
1. Select the **Employee Self-Service** agent and choose **Install** in the popup.

The ESS agent is now installed in your selected Power Platform environment with a preferred solution that can be exported and imported into another environment.
