# Usage analytics for the Employee Self-Service agent

>[!NOTE]
>The Employee Self-Service agent is currently in limited public preview. Deployment processes are subject to change before this product becomes generally available.

You can use different intefaces to monitor ESS agent usage depending on the role in your organization that is in charge of monitoring analytics.

As an application or service owner with the Environment Maker role, you can view analytics in Copilot Studio by navigating to the **Analytics** tab.

For advanced reporting requirements, you can integrate Azure Application Insights with Copilot Studio to gather more telemetry.

## Analyze conversational agent effectiveness

The **Analytics** page in Copilot Studio provides an aggregated insight into the overall effectiveness of your agent across the analytics session. [Learn more about analyzing conversational agent effectiveness.](/microsoft-copilot-studio/analytics-improve-agent-effectiveness)

## Provide feedback

Feedback about Copilot is collected from Copilot experiences, such as when selecting a thumbs up or thumbs down on a response from Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps. After a user selects one of the thumb options, the feedback pane appears and asks for more information, including what the user liked (thumbs up) or what went wrong (thumbs down).

>[!NOTE]
>If using Copilot for work or school, the IT admin can turn off feedback. If the thumb options don't appear next to Copilot responses or if selecting a thumb doesn't open the feedback pane, your organization's IT admin has likely turned off feedback.

You can view feedback in the [Microsoft feedback portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback). To view feedback that's been submitted to Microsoft, select **My feedback** and sign in. If using Copilot at work or school, your IT admin might not allow use of the feedback portal.

## Auditing and logging

The ESS agent is built on Copilot and Power Platform. You can therefore use auditing capabilities from these platforms to log and monitor usage.

### Audit with Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview provides features for a comprehensive audit record of end-user activities when interacting with agents. [Learn how to audit user interactions with agents in Microsoft Purview.](/power-platform/release-plan/2024wave2/microsoft-copilot-studio/audit-user-interactions-agents-purview)

[Audit logs for Copilot and AI activities](/purview/audit-copilot).

### Audit with Azure Application Insights

You can [use Azure Application Insights to capture telemetry for custom Copilot Agents.](/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-bot-framework-composer-capture-telemetry?tabs=webApp)

### Security information and event management (SIEM)

For any SIEM integrations, use Application Insights or the Power Platform Dataverse auditing capabilities.
