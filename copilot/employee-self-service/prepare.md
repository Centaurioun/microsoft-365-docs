# Prepare to deploy the Employee Self-Service agent

>[!NOTE]
>The Employee Self-Service agent is currently in limited public preview. Deployment processes are subject to change before this product becomes generally available.

Preparation is the first step to deploying the Employee Self-Service (ESS) agent. First, you need to meet the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) The following roles are required to prepare the agent for deployment.

|Role |Activities to perform |Configuration areas |
|-----|----------------------|--------------------|
|Global admin |Assign the Power Platform Administrator role. |Microsoft admin center |
|Power Platform Administrator |Assign the Environment Maker role. |Power Platform admin center |
|Environment Maker |Create environments required for customizing and testing the ESS agent. |Power Platform admin center and Microsoft Copilot Studio |
|InfoSec/ IT Infrastructure/ Change control board |Configure infrastructure requirements for third-party ISV integration. |Network firewall policies and single sign-on |

## Assign the Power Platform administrator role

1. Sign in as a Global admin to your [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Roles**, then choose **Role assignments**.
1. In the **Microsoft Entra ID** section, find the **Power Platform Administrator** role.
1. Add identified users in the **Assigned** section.

## Set up your Power Platform environment and assign the Environment Maker role

1. Sign into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) as a Power Platform administrator.
1. Create a new environment, or select an existing environment to install the ESS agent.
1. Select **+New** in the ribbon to create a new environment. Configure the following features:
    1. **Make this a Managed Environment**: Enable or disable based on your governance.
    1. **Get new features early**: Not required.
    1. Add a **Dataverse data store**.
1. Under **Access**, select **Security roles**.
1. From the list of security roles, select **Environment Maker**. Choose **Members** in the top ribbon.
1. Select **Add people** in the ribbon to add the designated person who can configure and publish the ESS agent. This person is typically the agent owner in your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>Environment Makers can't install new agents. Only the environment administrators can install new agents.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Important: Familiarize yourself with the Power Platform subscription plans and billing policies for your tenant. It’s recommended to perform initial [capacity planning](prerequisites.md#capacity-planning) before enabling and configuring the ESS agent to make sure you won’t incur additional billing.

## Infrastructure setup for third-party ISV integration

Most organizations have secured their third-party HR systems and knowledge sources from external networks to protect sensitive information about employees, organizations, knowledge assets, and other data.

You’ll need to make these systems accessible to the Power Platform environment where the ESS agent is hosted in order to integrate them into the agent.

These systems must be configured with allowlists for the source IP addresses from the Power Platform environment where the ESS agent is hosted and executed.
