# Frequently Asked Questions about Microsoft 365 Copilot Search

## General

**What is Microsoft 365 Copilot Search?**

Microsoft 365 Copilot Search delivers an AI-powered, unified search experience optimized for work and school. It indexes content across Microsoft 365 apps as well as third-party apps, leveraging the Microsoft Graph to interpret user context, behavioral signals, and organizational relationships. This enables it to return highly personalized, context-aware answers to complex queries.

**What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Microsoft Search?**

Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is designed as an AI-powered, enterprise-grade search assistant. It understands natural language, context, relationships, and user behavior to deliver personalized, relevant results. It goes beyond keyword matching to interpret intent and provide AI-generated answers with references and follow-up options.

[Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search), by contrast, is a more traditional search experience. It relies on keyword-based queries and returns a list of links or documents. While it integrates with Microsoft 365, it lacks the conversational and contextual depth of Copilot Search.

**What are the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot Search and Copilot Search in Bing?**

Microsoft 365 Copilot Search is an AI-powered universal search experience optimized for work and school. It's available to users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license and is accessed through the Microsoft 365 app. It helps you quickly find relevant results from your organization, searching across all your Microsoft 365 apps and any third-party apps integrated via Microsoft Graph connectors. It also adheres to the same data protection, privacy standards, and security configurations as Microsoft 365 Copilot. 

[Copilot Search in Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/copilot-search/), by contrast, is an AI-powered search engine designed for individual users who aren't necessarily using it for work or school. It's accessed through a web browser and doesn't require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

**Does Microsoft 365 Copilot Search support natural language queries?**

Yes, Microsoft 365 Copilot Search does support natural language queries.

This means you can type questions or requests in everyday language—like "show me the latest updates from the marketing team” or "find the presentation Rachel shared last week”—and Copilot Search will understand your intent and return relevant results from across Microsoft 365 (emails, files, chats, meetings, and more).

It's designed to go beyond keyword matching by using AI to interpret context, relationships, and meaning, helping you find what you need faster and more intuitively.

**Does Microsoft 365 Copilot Search still support traditional keyword queries?**

Yes, Microsoft 365 Copilot Search also supports traditional keyword queries.

**What languages are supported by Microsoft 365 Copilot Search?**

Copilot Search supports the same languages as Microsoft 365 Copilot generally. See the [list of supported languages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/supported-languages-for-microsoft-365-copilot-94518d61-644b-4118-9492-617eea4801d8).
