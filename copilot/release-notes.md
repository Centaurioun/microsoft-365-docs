### Teams
- **Improvements to the transcription experience in meetings** [Windows, Mac]

  These updates enhance the transcription experience in meetings. When transcription, recording, or Copilot is enabled, users are prompted to choose the spoken language for accurate captions. Once transcription is running, only the organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator can change that language. A new settings page under Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language, along with a matching option under Transcript > Language settings, streamlines configuration. If someone speaks a language that doesn’t match the selected one, The organizer/co-organizer and initiator receives a mismatch notification so they can adjust quickly.
