# Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple account access to Copilot is currently disabled for all work and school documents. Multiple account access to Copilot will be enabled in March 2025 at the earliest, but a policy setting to turn it off ahead of time is expected to be available by the end of January 2025.

## What is multiple account access to Copilot?

In Microsoft 365 apps that support signing in with multiple accounts (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote desktop and mobile apps), users can use their Copilot access from one account on documents from a different account.

Multiple account access to Copilot is currently disabled, but once enabled, your users may use Copilot on work documents without a Copilot license assigned from your organization.  

## Data protection

Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access.

The setting for [web grounding in Copilot](manage-public-web-access.md) is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disable web grounding in Copilot for a user in your organization, that user isn't able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.

Users using multiple account access to Copilot on work and school documents also have limited access to Copilot as shown in the following table:


| Copilot capability                                                                          | Multiple account access to Copilot | Internal Microsoft 365 Copilot license |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Access the organizationâ€™s Microsoft Graph                                                   |No |Yes|
| Ask Copilot questions about the current open document and make Copilot assisted edits       |Yes|Yes|
| Ask Copilot questions about other documents that aren't the currently opened document      |No|Yes|
| Ask Copilot questions that can be answered through web searches ([if web search is enabled](manage-public-web-access.md))|Yes|Yes|
| Generate drafts about work and school documents the user has access to                      |Yes|Yes|

## Manage multiple account access to Copilot using Cloud Policy

You can use the "Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents" policy setting to control whether your users can use multiple account access to Copilot on work and school documents. This policy only applies to Microsoft 365 apps that allow signing in with multiple accounts (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote desktop and mobile apps).

To configure this policy setting, you can use [Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy).

> [!NOTE]
> This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025.

If you enable or don't configure this policy setting, your users can use Copilot on work and school documents with a Copilot license that is from outside your organization.

If you disable this policy setting, your users can't use Copilot on work and school documents with a Copilot license that is from outside your organization.

The end-user experience for blocked users viewing work and school documents is as follows:

- All on-canvas Copilot UX is removed, both on-canvas Copilot entry points and proactive features like Word summary.

- If the user is signed in with an account with Copilot, the Copilot button in the ribbon remains active. However, your users can't use any Copilot capabilities; clicking the button displays an error message indicating that multiple account access to Copilot is blocked.
