# Our commitment to responsible AI

Microsoft is committed to responsibly designing, building, and releasing AI technologies—keeping humans at the center and guided by our principles.

## User data privacy controls

[Review the data privacy controls we offer for admins](people-skills-sharing-inferencing-controls.md) to control default AI inferencing and skill visibility settings for their tenant or groups of users.  

Users can also opt out of AI inferencing or skill sharing on their profile. For more information, see [Manage AI and sharing options](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-ai-and-sharing-options-90c09758-c877-4940-bc2c-f7e4caea6ae4).

### Data location

You can find the actual location of your data in Microsoft 365 Admin Center. As a tenant administrator, you can find the actual data location for committed data by navigating to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Org Settings** > **Organization Profile** > **Data Location**.
