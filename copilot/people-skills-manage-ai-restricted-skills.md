# Manage AI-restricted skills

Admins can mark certain skills as AI-restricted, such as those that might be considered confidential or sensitive in nature. These could include skills related to specific projects, proprietary technologies, or other areas that an organization might want to exclude from being used in AI based skill inferencing.

AI restricted skills won't be suggested to users in your tenant. Our inference engine ensures that any AI restricted skills identified by the admin will be updated and removed from user profiles within 24 hours. However, a user is able to manually add any skill from taxonomy to their profile, including AI restricted skills.

To mark skills as AI restricted, refer to the below steps:

1. To mark skills in the default library as AI-restricted, under _Skills,_ select _People Skills Library_.

1.  Select one or more skills that need to be tagged as AI-restricted using the check box

1. On the window pop-up, select _Add AI restricted_ tag
