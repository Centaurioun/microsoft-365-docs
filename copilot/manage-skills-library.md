### Manage out-of-the-box skills library

View, add, or delete the skills you selected from the out-of-the-box library. The more skills you include from the out-of-the-box library, the more specific AI-generated skill profiles are for users. Our recommendation is to use all 16,000 skills, with a minimum of 500 skills.

 



 

Navigate to the People Skills setup page and select __Skills__ to manage your skills library.

1.      Under __Skills,__ select __People Skills Library__.

2.      Review the list. You can filter by domain and search by skill name.

3.      To add skills, select __Add Skills__. Select the skills you want to add. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select __Add__.

4.      To delete skills, select the skills you want to delete. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select __Delete skills__. Select __Delete__ again to confirm you want to delete the selected skills.

Deleting skills removes the skills and associated skills data from your organization and from your users' experience.

5.      Select __Done__.
