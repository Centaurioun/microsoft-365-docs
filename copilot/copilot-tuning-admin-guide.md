# Microsoft 365 Copilot Tuning admin guide (preview)

Microsoft 365 Copilot Tuning enables organizations to securely fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using tenant-specific data, and to deploy those fine-tuned models as declarative agents within Microsoft 365 Copilot. As an AI Admin, you retain full control over who can fine-tune models, how they are published, and how they are governed throughout their lifecycle.

This article provides information about the governance controls that are available for Copilot Tuning in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot Tuning is currently available for Early Access Preview (EAP).

## Prerequisites

To manage Copilot Tuning governance controls, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- Copilot Tuning Early Access Preview (EAP) enrollment. To enroll in the EAP:
    - Your tenant must have at least 5,000 active Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.
    - An AI Admin must accept the EAP terms on behalf of the organization.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your tenant doesn't show Copilot Tuning, contact Microsoft support or your account team to request EAP provisioning.
- You must have one of the following roles:
    - Global Administrator
    - AI Administrator (if defined as a custom role in your organization)
- Copilot extensibility is enabled via Copilot Settings in your organization.
