# Controls to manage file uploads in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

File upload is enabled by default in both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. It lets users upload files like Word docs, Excel files, and PDFs to prompt Copilot and Copilot Chat to reason over them as part of its response. File upload limits apply in Copilot Chat.

To manage the file upload feature so it aligns with organizational policies, user preferences, and security considerations, an admin control is available. This control allows admins to determine whether users can upload local files or attach cloud files when using Copilot or Copilot Chat. 

> [!NOTE]
> The file upload control will be available [notes on release date(s)]

## IT admin file upload control for both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

The file upload control is available only in [Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy). If you enable this policy setting, you can choose one of the following options for file uploads in Copilot and Copilot Chat:  
- **Allow file uploads in both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**—allows users to upload files in both experiences. This is the default setting.
- **Prevent file uploads in both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**—disables file upload in both experiences.
- **Disable file uploads in Microsoft 365 Copilot Web mode and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat while allowing them in Microsoft 365 Copilot Work mode**—enables file upload in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat *Work mode only* and disables file upload in Microsoft 365 Copilot Web mode and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. 
 
If you don't configure the **File upload control in Copilot policy**, the file upload feature will be available to users in both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat.  

> [!NOTE]
> The file upload control is currently available only for Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat on desktop (Windows), and web. The control will be available for Microsoft 365 apps in [broad date].
