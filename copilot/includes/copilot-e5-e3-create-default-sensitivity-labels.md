1. Sign into the [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com/) as an admin in one of the groups listed at [Sensitivity labels - permissions](/purview/get-started-with-sensitivity-labels#permissions-required-to-create-and-manage-sensitivity-labels).

2. Select **Solutions** > **DSPM for AI** > **Overview**.
3. In the **Recommendations** section, select **Information Protection Policy for Sensitivity Labels**. This step creates the default labels and their policies.
4. To see or edit the default labels, or to create your own labels, select **Information protection** > **Sensitivity labels**. You might have to select **Refresh**.

When you have the default sensitivity labels:

- The labels help protect your data and can affect Copilot results.
- Your users can start manually applying published labels to their files and emails.
- Admins can start creating policies and configuring features that automatically apply labels to files and emails.

At any time, you can create your own sensitivity labels. To learn more, see [Create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies](/purview/create-sensitivity-labels).
