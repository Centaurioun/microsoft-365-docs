# Troubleshoot the Microsoft 365 admin center task fine-tuning

This article describes some of the most common issues with Copilot Tuning in the Microsoft 365 admin center and how to troubleshoot them.

[!INCLUDE [copilot-tuning-preview](includes/copilot-tuning-preview.md)]

## I don't see Copilot Tuning in the admin center settings

If you don't see Copilot tuning in the admin center, make sure you have the required licenses and permissions. Your tenant must have at least 5,000 Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on licenses and you must accept the Early Access Preview (EAP) terms to enable this feature.

## Setup is taking more than 5 minutes

If the setup takes more than 5 minutes, it might be due to service failures or other issues. If the setup is not completed within an hour, reach out to support.

## I accidentally deleted a model

If a model is deleted, it can't be recovered. Make sure you have the correct permissions and take necessary precautions to avoid deleting a model accidentally.

## Insufficient training data

If the training data is insufficient, you get an error message. Make sure you have enough training data after filtering.

## While completing the configuration, I get an error message

If you see an error message during the configuration, retry the process after some time. It might be due to service outages or other temporary issues.

## Errors related to knowledge sources

If you enter a link to a knowledge source you don't have access to, an error message is displayed. Make sure you have access to the required knowledge sources.

## Validation fails during the training process

If the validation fails, make sure all required fields are filled. If you ask seven questions, all seven must be answered.

## Security group coverage issues

If the selected security groups don't have access to the required knowledge sources, choose a suggested set of security groups to share with. Make sure permissions are correctly set, and wait for them to sync.
