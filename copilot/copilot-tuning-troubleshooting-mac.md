# Troubleshoot the Microsoft Admin Center task fine-tuning FAQ

This article describes some of the most common issues with the Microsoft Admin Center task fine-tuning FAQ and how to troubleshoot them.

## I see the task-specific models in the settings

The task-specific models should always be there. If you don't see them, ensure you have the required licenses and permissions. You need at least 5,000 Copilot licenses for this feature to be available.

## An admin doesn't see the task-specific models

If an admin doesn't see the task-specific models, it could be due to eligibility issues. Ensure you have the necessary licenses and permissions. If you're not eligible, you will see an error screen explaining why.

## The setup is taking more than 5 minutes

If the setup takes more than 5 minutes, it might be due to service failures or other issues. If the setup is not completed within an hour, reach out to support.

## Managing access to the task-specific models

Admins can manage access to the task-specific models by adding specific users to the organization. Once added, users receive an email with a link to the model.

## What should I do if I accidentally delete a model?

If a model is deleted, it can't be recovered. Ensure you have the correct permissions and take necessary precautions to avoid accidental deletions.

## There's insufficient training data

If there's insufficient training data, you see an error message. Ensure you have enough training data after filtering.

## What should I do if I see an error message during the configuration?

If you see an error message during the configuration, retry the process after some time. It might be due to service outages or other temporary issues.

## How do I handle errors related to knowledge sources?

If you enter a link to a knowledge source you don't have access to, you see an error message. Ensure you have access to the required knowledge sources.

## What should I do if the validation fails during the training process?

If the validation fails, ensure all required fields are correctly filled. If you ask 7 questions, all 7 must be answered.

## How do I address issues with security group coverage?
If the selected security groups don't have access to the required knowledge sources, choose a suggested set of security groups to share with. Ensure permissions are correctly set and wait for them to sync.
