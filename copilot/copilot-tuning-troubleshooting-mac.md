[!INCLUDE [copilot-tuning-preview](includes/copilot-tuning-preview.md)]

## I don't see the task-specific models in the settings

Task-specific models should always be available. If you don't see them, make sure you have the required licenses and permissions. You need at least 5,000 Copilot licenses for this feature to be available.

## An admin doesn't see the task-specific models

If an admin doesn't see the task-specific models, it could be due to eligibility issues. Make sure you have the necessary licenses and permissions. If you're not eligible, an error is displayed with possible causes.

## The setup is taking more than 5 minutes

If the setup takes more than 5 minutes, it might be due to service failures or other issues. If the setup is not completed within an hour, reach out to support.

## Managing access to the task-specific models

Admins can manage access to the task-specific models by adding specific users to the organization. Once added, users receive an email with a link to the model.

## I accidentally deleted a model

If a model is deleted, it can't be recovered. Make sure you have the correct permissions and take necessary precautions to avoid accidental deletions.

## There's insufficient training data

If there's insufficient training data, you get an error message. Make sure you have enough training data after filtering.

## While completing the configuration, I get an error message

If you see an error message during the configuration, retry the process after some time. It might be due to service outages or other temporary issues.

## Errors related to knowledge sources

If you enter a link to a knowledge source you don't have access to, an error message is displayed. Make sure you have access to the required knowledge sources.

## The validation fails during the training process

If the validation fails, make sure all required fields are correctly filled. If you ask 7 questions, all 7 must be answered.

## Security group coverage issues

If the selected security groups don't have access to the required knowledge sources, choose a suggested set of security groups to share with. Make sure permissions are correctly set, and wait for them to sync.
