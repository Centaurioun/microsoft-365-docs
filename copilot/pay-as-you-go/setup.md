# Set up pay-as-you-go for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Setting up the pay-as-you-go plan for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat can be done directly from the Microsoft 365 admin center. This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and manage pay-as-you-go billing.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription and resource group
  - You must have an owner or contributor Azure role to an Azure subscription to set up the pay-as-you-go service.
  - You must have an owner or contributor Azure role to an Azure resource group linked to the same Azure subscription to set up the pay-as-you-go service.
  - To learn more, see [Use the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager to Manage Resource Groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).
- One of the following administrator roles:
  - Global administrator
  - Billing administrator
  - AI administrator

## Steps to set up pay-as-you-go billing

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Copilot** > **Settings**.
1. If not already set up, create an Azure subscription and resource group.
1. Select the Azure subscription, resource group, and region for the pay-as-you-go setup.
1. Enable consumption-based billing for the desired Copilot scenarios.

## Managing pay-as-you-go billing

As an admin, you can do the following to manage pay-as-you-billing for your organization:

- **View usage and costs** You can view detailed reports on Copilot usage and the associated costs.
- **Edit billing** Modify an unhealthy Azure subscription, resource group, and billing region.
- **Turn off billing** You can turn off pay-as-you-go billing for any of the Copilot services, removing the service from the agent's view. Once the service has been turned off, users without a Copilot license wonâ€™t be able to use the service.
