# View costs and billing for Microsoft 365 Copilot pay-as-you-go

The [Microsoft 365 Copilot pay-as-you-go service](overview.md) offers a flexible and cost-effective way for organizations to access Copilot services.

Your organization's consumption of the pay-as-you-go service can be monitored in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) > [Cost Management](/microsoft-365/commerce/use-cost-mgmt) page for each Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go service that you use, including Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat.

This article explains how administrators can view cost and billing details for pay-as-you-go.

## Access usage and billing information

To view detailed reports on Copilot usage and the associated costs, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) with one of the following administrator roles:

    - Global administrator
    - Billing administrator

2. Go to **Billing** > **Cost Management**.
3. On the **Cost Management** page, under **Service family**, you can see a service-level view of costs based on Copilot usage.

You can also view costs in the Azure portal using [Microsoft Cost Management](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management). You can filter the accumulated costs using tags, like `m365copilotchat`:

Billed amounts are updated daily (and sometimes more frequently). But, it can take up to 24 hours after usage of a service to show up in Azure Cost Management.
