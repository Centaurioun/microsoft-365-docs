# View costs and billing for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat pay-as-you-go

The Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat pay-as-you-go service offers a flexible and cost-effective way for organizations to access Copilot services. This article explains how administrators can view cost and billing details for pay-as-you-go.

## Access usage and billing information

To view detailed reports on Copilot usage and the associated costs, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center with one of the following administrator roles:

    - Global administrator
    - Billing administrator
    - AI administrator

2. In the admin center, go to **Billing** > **Cost Management**.
3. On the **Cost Management** page, under **Service family**, you can see a service-level view of costs based on Copilot usage.
4. Alternatively, you can view costs in the Azure portal using Azure Cost Management. Billed amounts are updated daily (and sometimes more frequently), but it can take up to 24 hours after usage of a service to show up in Azure Cost Management.

## Monitor costs

You can monitor the organization's consumption of the pay-as-you-go service through the Cost Management page. This helps in managing costs and making informed decisions about scaling and usage.

- **Usage insights** View top usage data and detailed views of usage and costs.
- **Cost trends** Analyze cost trends over time to understand usage patterns and optimize spending.
