# Manage your skills library in People Skills

After completing the [initial setup](people-skills-setup.md), you can return to the People Skills page in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to manage the skills library and admin settings.

You can find People Skills setup page by visiting the Copilot page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/featureexplorer) and selecting **People Skills in Microsoft 365 Copilot**. Alternatively, you can find People Skills page under **Settings** > **Viva** > **Data Management**.

If you're looking for how to set up People Skills for the first time, see [Set up People Skills](people-skills-setup.md). 

## Options to manage your skills library

You can manage your skills library in the following ways:

- [Manage out-of-the-box library](people-skills-manage-skills-library.md): Add and delete skills from a previously selected list of skills from the out-of-the-box library.

- [Manage custom skills](people-skills-manage-custom-skill.md): Add custom skills if you haven’t previously added them during the initial setup. You can also reimport custom skills, add new ones, or delete custom skills at any point.

- [Manage AI-restricted skills](people-skills-manage-custom-skill.md): Mark certain skills as sensitive to restrict them from being returned by skills AI inferencing.

- [Import or export skills](people-skills-import-export-skills.md): Import user skills from third-party platforms and export your custom skills library or confirmed user skills for each individual user in your tenant.

### Manage out-of-the-box skills library

You can view, add, or delete the skills that you selected from the out-of-the-box library. The more skills you include from the out-of-the-box library, the more specific AI-generated skill profiles are for the users. Our recommendation is to use all 16,000 skills, with a minimum of 500 skills.

To view, add, or delete the skills that you selected from the out-of-the-box library, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the People Skills setup page and select *Skills** to manage your skills library.
2. Under **Skills**, select **People Skills Library**.
3. Review the list. You can also filter the list by domain or search by skill name.
4. To add skills, select **Add Skills**. You can filter by domain or search by skill name. Select **Add**.
5. To delete skills, select the skills you want to delete. You can filter by domain or search by skill name. Select **Delete skills**. Select **Delete** again to confirm you want to delete the selected skills.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Deleting skills removes the skills and associated skills data from your organization and from your users' experience.

6. Select **Done**.
