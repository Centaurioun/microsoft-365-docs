# Manage your skills library in People Skills

After completing the initial setup, you can return to the People Skills page in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to manage the skills library and admin settings.

**How to find People Skills setup page**: 

- In the Copilot page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/featureexplorer), select **People Skills in Microsoft 365 Copilot** 

- OR you can also find People Skills under _Settings_, then _Viva_, under the **Data Management** tab

If you are looking for how to setup People Skills for the first time, see [Set up People Skills](people-skills-setup.md). 

You can manage your skills library in the following ways:

- [Manage out-of-the-box library:](people-skills-manage-skills-library.md) Add and delete skills from a previously selected list of skills from the out-of-the-box library*

- [Manage custom skills:](people-skills-manage-custom-skill.md) Add custom skills if you haven’t previously added them during the initial setup. You can also reimport custom skills, add new ones, or delete custom skills

- [Manage AI-restricted skills:](people-skills-manage-custom-skill.md) Mark certain skills as sensitive to restrict them from being returned by skills AI inferencing

- [Manage skills import or export:](people-skills-import-export-skills.md)

  - Import user skills from third-party platforms
    
  - Export your custom skills library* or confirmed user skills for each individual user in your tenant
    
     


### Manage out-of-the-box skills library

View, add, or delete the skills you selected from the out-of-the-box library. The more skills you include from the out-of-the-box library, the more specific AI-generated skill profiles are for users. Our recommendation is to use all 16,000 skills, with a minimum of 500 skills.

 



 

Navigate to the People Skills setup page and select _Skills_ to manage your skills library.

1.      Under _Skills,_ select _People Skills Library_.

2.      Review the list. You can filter by domain and search by skill name.

3.      To add skills, select _Add Skills_. Select the skills you want to add. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select _Add_.

4.      To delete skills, select the skills you want to delete. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select _Delete skills_. Select _Delete_ again to confirm you want to delete the selected skills.

Deleting skills removes the skills and associated skills data from your organization and from your users' experience.

5.      Select _Done_.
