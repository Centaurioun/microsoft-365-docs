=== Disclaimer

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) may include live,
real-time observations and threat indicators, including malicious
infrastructure and adversary-threat tooling. Any IP and domain searches
within our Defender TI platform are safe to search. Microsoft will share
online resources (e.g., IP addresses, domain names) that should be
considered real threats posing a clear and present danger. We ask that
users use their best judgment and minimize unnecessary risk while
interacting with malicious systems when performing the tutorial below.
Please note that Microsoft has worked to minimize risk by defanging
malicious IP addresses, hosts, and domains.

=== Before You Begin

As the disclaimer states above, suspicious, and malicious indicators
have been defanged for your safety. Please remove any brackets from IPs,
domains, and hosts when searching in Defender TI. Do not search these
indicators directly in your browser.

=== Open Defender TI’s Threat Intelligence Home Page

* Access the https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/[Defender Threat
Intelligence Portal].
