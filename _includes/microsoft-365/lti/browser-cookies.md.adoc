== Allow cookies for LMS URLs in your browser

Third-party browser cookies are needed to complete the LTI 1.3 handshake according to IMS Global standards.
Therefore, when launching the LTI tool from a Learning Management System (LMS), the browser setting must allow third-party cookies for the LMS URL.

Here are the steps to allow the cookies in your browser.

== <<tab/edge,Microsoft Edge>>

=== Allow cookies for LMS URLS in Microsoft Edge

. In the Edge *Settings* window, select *Cookies and site permissions* > *Cookies and data stored* > *Manage and delete cookies and site data*.
. Turn on *Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)*, and make sure that *Block third-party cookies* is turned off.

If you must keep third-party cookies blocked:

. In the Edge *Settings* window, select *Cookies and site permissions* > *Cookies and data stored* > *Manage and delete cookies and site data*.
. Under *Allow*, select *Add* to add the domain URL of the LMS platform.
 .. For example, if the LMS platform is hosted at `+https://contoso.com+`, then that URL must be added under *Allow*.
