== Review remediation actions in Microsoft 365 Business Premium

Okay, you've discovered a security breach, but what do you do?
It depends on the nature of it.

Examples of remediation actions include sending a file to quarantine, stopping a process from running, or completely removing a scheduled task.
All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center, which is located at https://security.microsoft.com/action-center.
