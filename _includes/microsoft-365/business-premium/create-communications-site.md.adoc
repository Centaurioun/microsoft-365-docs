== Create a communications site

A great way to communicate priorities, share strategy documents, and highlight upcoming events is to use a communications site in SharePoint, and that's what this mission is all about.
Communications sites are for sharing things broadly across your whole business or campaign &mdash;
it's your internal strategy site and tactical room.

=== Best practices

Include the following elements in a Communications site:

. Add your logo and colors as a header image and theme.
. Lead with your strategy, message, important documents, a directory, and FAQ in a *Hero web part*.
. Include a CEO or candidate statement to the team in a *Text web part*.
. Add events to an *Events web part* so everyone can see what's coming up.
. Add photos that people can use or share to an *Image gallery web part*.

=== Admin settings

If you don't see the *+ Create* site link, self-service site creation might not be available in Microsoft 365.
To create a team site, contact the person administering Microsoft 365 in your organization.
If you're a Microsoft 365 admin, see link:/sharepoint/manage-site-creation[Manage site creation in SharePoint Online] to enable self-service site creation for your organization or link:/sharepoint/manage-sites-in-new-admin-center[Manage sites in the new SharePoint admin center] to create a site from the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219[SharePoint admin center].
