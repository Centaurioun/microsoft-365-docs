== Maintain your environment

As you know, security incident management is important.
As threats are detected, those threats must be reviewed and addressed.
Your business also needs a maintenance and operations plan.
The missions you completed during the setup and configuration process were all about getting your systems, users, and data secured.
Now, you'll need to perform certain tasks, such as adding or removing users, resetting passwords, and resetting devices to factory settings as needed.
This is what maintaining your environment is all about.
