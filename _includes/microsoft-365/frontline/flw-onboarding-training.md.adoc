== Provide initial and ongoing training to help onboard your frontline workers

Get your employees ready to start and succeed in their roles on your frontline team with a custom onboarding and training process.
You can use initial onboarding to welcome new team members, familiarize them with roles and duties, and teach them about how your organization operates.
Then, use ongoing training to help your team maintain and grow their skills.

=== Initial training and onboarding

A smooth onboarding and initial training process is essential for new members of your frontline team to get up and running quickly.
If your team tends to have low turnover, your workers may benefit from a longer and more in-depth onboarding process.
If you employ a lot of seasonal or temporary workers on your frontline team, you may need a lighter onboarding experience.
You can also customize your onboarding process for different teams that require different levels of initial training.
