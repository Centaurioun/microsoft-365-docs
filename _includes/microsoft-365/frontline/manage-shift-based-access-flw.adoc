== Manage shift-based access for frontline workers in Teams

____
[!IMPORTANT] This feature has been deprecated.
____

=== Overview

Presence in Microsoft Teams indicates a user’s current availability and
status to other users. The presence of frontline workers is often less
predictable than other staff as their working hours are typically not
the same each day. As an admin, you can configure Teams to show a set of
shift-based presence states for the frontline workers in your
organization to indicate when they are on and off shift.

These shift-based presence
states—image:media/flw-presence-on-shift.png[Solid green check mark,
indicates On shift.] *On shift*,
image:media/flw-presence-off-shift.png[Gray circle with x, indicates Off
shift.] *Off shift*, image:media/flw-presence-busy.png[Solid red circle,
indicates Busy] *Busy*—are separate from the
link:/microsoftteams/presence-admins[default set of presence states] in
Teams. With these two sets of presence states, you can configure
different experiences for people in your organization based on their
role.

With shift-based access, you can manage access to Teams when frontline
workers are off shift. For example, you can set Teams to display a
message that frontline workers must acknowledge before they can use
Teams when they’re not on a scheduled shift.

=== Scenario

Here’s an example of how your organization can manage shift-based
access.

You have frontline workers in your organization that should only be paid
for hours they work on a shift that their manager scheduled and
approved. They shouldn’t be paid for time spent working outside a
scheduled shift, which includes using the Teams app. You set up a custom
message that says ``Your time on Teams when on off shift won’t count
toward payable hours'', which is displayed when frontline workers try to
access Teams when off shift. If they choose to use Teams, they click *I
accept* with the understanding that they won’t be paid for this time.

You also have information workers in your organization who are salaried
and who don’t work shifts. You configure your information workers to use
the default presence states in Teams while giving your frontline workers
shift-based presence.

=== Shift-based presence states

Here are the shift-based presence states.

=== Off shift access to Teams

This feature lets you manage access to Teams when frontline workers are
off shift. You can set Teams to display a message to frontline workers
if they access Teams when off shift. Frontline workers must click *I
accept* to acknowledge the message before they can use Teams.

You can use the default message, choose from a set of pre-defined
messages, or customize the message to display any text that you want.
Here’s the default message:

You can also set the frequency when the message is displayed and set a
grace period between when the first shift starts or last shift ends and
when access to Teams is restricted.

=== Manage shift-based access

As an admin, you use policies to control shift-based presence for
frontline workers in your organization. You manage these policies by
using the following PowerShell cmdlets:

* link:/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftspolicy[New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy]
* link:/powershell/module/teams/get-csteamsshiftspolicy[Get-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy]
* link:/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsshiftspolicy[Set-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy]
* link:/powershell/module/teams/grant-csteamsshiftspolicy[Grant-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy]
* link:/powershell/module/teams/remove-csteamsshiftspolicy[Remove-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy]

Use the New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy cmdlet to create a new policy, set the
policy settings that you want, and then use the
Grant-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy cmdlet to assign the policy to users.

Here’s some examples. For detailed information about each policy setting
and parameter, including the list of predefined off shift messages that
you can choose from, see
link:/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftspolicy[New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy].

==== Example 1

In this example, we create a new policy named Off Shift Teams Access
Default Message. In this policy, shift-based presence is turned on and
the default message is displayed every time a user who is assigned this
policy accesses Teams when off shift. The user can use Teams when off
shift if they accept the message, and the grace period between when the
first shift starts or last shift ends and when access is restricted is
10 minutes.

[source,powershell]
----
New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy -Identity "Off Shift Teams Access Default Message" -EnableShiftPresence $true -ShiftNoticeFrequency always -ShiftNoticeMessageType DefaultMessage -AccessType UnrestrictedAccess_TeamsApp -AccessGracePeriodMinutes 10
----

____
[!NOTE] Use the *ShiftNoticeMessageType* parameter to set the message
that you want to display. To see a list of the pre-defined messages that
you can choose from for this parameter, see
link:/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftspolicy[New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy].
____

==== Example 2

In this example, we create a new policy named Off Shift Teams Access
Custom Message. In this policy, shift-based presence is turned on and a
custom message is displayed every time a user who is assigned this
policy accesses Teams when off shift. The user can use Teams when off
shift if they accept the message, and the grace period between when the
first shift starts or last shift ends and when access is restricted is
15 minutes.

[source,powershell]
----
New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy -Identity "Off Shift Teams Access Custom Message" -EnableShiftPresence $true -ShiftNoticeFrequency always -ShiftNoticeMessageType CustomMessage -ShiftNoticeMessageCustom "Your time on Teams when on off shift won't count toward payable hours" -AccessType UnrestrictedAccess_TeamsApp -AccessGracePeriodMinutes 15
----

____
[!NOTE] Use the *ShiftNoticeMessageType* parameter to set the message
that you want to display. To learn more, see
link:/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftspolicy[New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy].
____

==== Example 3

In this example, we create a new policy named Off Shift Teams Access
Message1. In this policy, shift-based presence is turned on and the
following predefined message is displayed every time a user who is
assigned this policy accesses Teams when off shift.

``Your employer does not authorize or approve of the use of its network,
applications, systems, or tools by non-exempt or hourly employees during
their non-working hours. By accepting, you acknowledge that your use of
Teams while off shift is not authorized and you will not be
compensated.''

The user can use Teams when off shift if they accept the message, and
the grace period between when the first shift starts or last shift ends
and when access is restricted is three minutes.

[source,powershell]
----
New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy -Identity "Off Shift Teams Access Message1" -EnableShiftPresence $true -ShiftNoticeFrequency always -ShiftNoticeMessageType Message1 -AccessType  UnrestrictedAccess_TeamsApp -AccessGracePeriodMinutes 3
----

____
[!NOTE] Use the *ShiftNoticeMessageType* parameter to set the message
that you want to display. To see a list of the pre-defined messages that
you can choose from for this parameter, see
link:/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsshiftspolicy[New-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy].
____

==== Example 4

In this example, we assign a policy named Off Shift Teams Access Custom
Message to a user named remy@contoso.com.

[source,powershell]
----
Grant-CsTeamsShiftsPolicy -Identity remy@contoso.com -PolicyName "Off Shift Teams Access Custom Message"
