With Shifts, frontline managers and workers can seamlessly manage schedules and keep in touch.

Managers can create, update, and manage shift schedules for their teams.
They can assign shifts, add open shifts, and approve schedule requests from employees.
Employees can view their own and their team's schedules, set their availability, request to swap or offer a shift, request time off, and clock in and out.
