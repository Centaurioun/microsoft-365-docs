To complete the steps in this article, you must be a Microsoft 365
global admin or a Shifts connector admin.

The Shifts connector admin role is a custom role that you create in
Azure AD and assign to a user. The name of the role must be ``Shifts
connector admin''. The role doesn’t need to have any specific
permissions, although, at least one permission must be set when you
create it. The service relies on the presence of the role on the user,
and not its permissions. To learn more, see
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-create[Create and assign a
custom role in Azure AD] and
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal[Assign Azure AD
roles to users]. Keep in mind that it can take up to 24 hours for the
role to be created and applied to a user.
