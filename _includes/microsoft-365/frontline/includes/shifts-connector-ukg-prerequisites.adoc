Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Your UKG Dimensions service account name and password and service
URLs:
** Application program interface URL
** Application key
** Client ID
** Client secret
** Single Sign On URL
+
If you donâ€™t have this information, contact UKG Dimensions support.
* Federated single sign-on (SSO) authentication is enabled in your UKG
Dimensions environment. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the
supported identity provider for SSO. To enable SSO, set up integration
between Azure AD and UKG Dimensions. For a step-by-step tutorial, see
link:/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/kronos-workforce-dimensions-tutorial[Tutorial:
Azure AD SSO integration with Kronos Workforce Dimensions]. If you need
help or more information about setting up SSO, contact UKG Dimensions
support.
+
After the integration is set up, configure users as federated accounts
on their profile page in UKG Dimensions.
* At least one team is set up in Teams.
* You added a Microsoft 365 system account as a team owner to all teams
you want to map. link:/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users[Create
this account in Microsoft 365] and assign it a Microsoft 365 license.
Then, add the account as a team owner to all teams that you want to map.
The Shifts connector uses this account when syncing Shifts changes from
UKG Dimensions.
+
We recommend that you create an account specifically for this purpose
and not use your user account.
