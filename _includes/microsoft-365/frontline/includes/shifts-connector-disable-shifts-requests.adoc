[!IMPORTANT] Follow these steps only if you chose to disable open
shifts, open shift requests, swap requests, or time off requests using
the script in the link:#change-connection-settings[Change connection
settings] section earlier in this article or by using the
link:/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsshiftsconnectioninstance[Set-CsTeamsShiftsConnectionInstance]
cmdlet. Completing this step hides the capability in Shifts. Without
this second step, users will still see the capability in Shifts, and
will get an ``unsupported operation'' error message if they try to use
it.
____

To hide open shifts, swap requests, and time off requests in Shifts, use
the Graph API link:/graph/api/resources/schedule[schedule resource type]
to set the following parameters to `false` for each team that you mapped
to a WFM instance:

* Open shifts: `openShiftsEnabled`
* Swap requests: `swapShiftsRequestsEnabled`
* Time off requests: `timeOffRequestsEnabled`

To hide open shifts requests in Shifts, go to *Settings* in Shifts, and
then turn off the *Open shifts* setting.
