support, and selling products, or employees directly involved in the
manufacturing and distribution of products and services. Microsoft 365
for frontline workers helps support employee experiences in the
following areas so that your frontline workers can do their best work

==== Licensing for your frontline workers

https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline[Microsoft
365 for frontline workers] is optimized for a mobile workforce that
primarily interacts with customers, but also needs to stay connected to
the rest of your organization.

Microsoft 365 for frontline workers refers to the Microsoft 365 F3 and
F1 licenses or Office 365 F3 license, but you can also use an Enterprise
license (E1, E3, E5) to implement any of the frontline scenarios. Learn

workers] and which license types you should use for different types of

=== Adoption principles to help envision and implement business scenarios

You can implement many helpful scenarios for frontline workers quickly,
using out-of-the-box capabilities. For a list of scenarios we recommend
and provide guidance for, see link:flw-choose-scenarios.md[Choose your
scenarios].

However, it also pays to spend time thinking through exactly what you
want to achieve organizationally and setting the appropriate groundwork.
Particularly if you need to enhance out-of-the-box scenarios with
integrated or custom solutions from solution providers or partners,
you’ll want to spend time planning and envisioning before you dive in.

The principles below are based on information from the
https://aka.ms/TeamsFLWSuccessKit[Frontline Worker Solutions Success
Kit]. Find more adoption resources on the
https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/frontline-workers/[frontline
worker section of the Microsoft Adoption site].
