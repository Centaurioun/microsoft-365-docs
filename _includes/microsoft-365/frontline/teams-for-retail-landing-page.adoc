== Get started with Microsoft 365 for retail organizations

Retail environments, with their rotating schedules and on-the-go staff,
have very different needs than other organizations. To get the most
benefit for your retail organization, you first choose which scenarios
Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams can help you with in your day-to-day
business operations, and then make sure that you prepare your Teams
environment with the right fundamentals, teams, and apps to support
those scenarios.

=== Get ready to roll out your scenarios - identify roles and responsibilities for scenarios

Now that you know what scenarios you want to implement and what you need
to support them, you can gather your team so you can plan, roll out, and
monitor how they’re working in your organization. For example, the
following roles might be needed to roll out these scenarios in your
organization:

[width="100%",cols="24%,22%,27%,27%",options="header",]
|===
|Image |Role |Responsibilities |Department
| |IT Administrator |Work with operations and retail management staff to
define scenarios and how they’ll work for the organization. Configure
settings in the Teams admin center, such as policies and templates, and
enable apps. Set up app settings (such as global Shifts settings) for
the organization. Add and license users. |IT department

| |Operations staff |Work with Administrators to define scenarios, and
determine which settings, policies, templates, and apps are needed for
Teams. Create regional or divisional teams from templates. Set up tasks,
lists, and approval flows for coordination between stores within a
region, or between stores and headquarters. Set up learning framework
for staff. |Central operations

| |Store manager |Work with Administrators and Operations staff to
define scenarios. Create teams for the store from templates. Set up
channels and apps for the teams, as needed. For example: a channel for
shift handovers. Set up store schedules in Shifts. Set up tasks, lists,
updates, and approval flows that are specific to the store. Set up
learning tasks for staff. |Store management
