Some services are only included with F3 licenses, such as email and the
Power Platform. Check out link:flw-licensing-options.md[Understand
frontline worker user types and licensing] to determine the type of
licenses you’ll need for your users.

=== Step 2: Set up your environment and core Microsoft 365

The Microsoft 365 admin center has a set of
link:/microsoft-365/enterprise/setup-guides-for-microsoft-365[Setup
guides] that walk you through the steps to set up the products, security
features, and collaboration tools in Microsoft 365. The setup guides are
accessible from the https://aka.ms/setupguidance[Setup guidance page] in
the Microsoft 365 admin center.

[arabic]
. Use the https://aka.ms/prepareyourenvironment[Prepare your
environment] guide to prepare your organization’s environment for
Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services.
. Use the https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide[Microsoft 365 setup]
guide to set up productivity tools, security policies, and device
management capabilities. You can also use this advisor to set up and
configure your organization’s devices.

=== Step 3: Provision users, configure groups, and assign licenses

Now that you have Microsoft 365 set up, you can start to add users,
organize them into groups, and assign licenses.

==== Provision users

Now that you have Microsoft 365 set up, you can start to add users,
organize them into groups, and assign licenses. Before you provision
frontline users, you should create new administrator accounts or review
and update your existing
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference[administrator
accounts in Azure AD].
link:/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles[Learn more about
what Azure AD admin roles you might need for Microsoft 365].

In this step, you’ll create user identities for your frontline workers
in Azure AD. You can import users in three ways:

* *Integrate Azure AD with an existing Active Directory instance:*
link:/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites[Azure
AD Connect] replicates Active Directory user accounts to Azure AD,
allowing a user to have a single identity capable of accessing both
local and cloud-based resources.
* *Integrate Azure AD with a third-party identity solution:* Azure AD
supports integration with some third-party providers through federation.
** https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/using-okta-for-hybrid-microsoft-aad-join/[Learn
how to use Okta for Hybrid Microsoft AAD Join].
** link:/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom#configuring-federation-with-pingfederate[Learn
how to configure PingFederate with Azure AD Connect].
* *Import users from your organization’s HR systems:*
link:/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-auto-user-provisioning[Azure
AD user provisioning service] automates the creation, maintenance, and
removal of user identities based on rules set by your organization.
** *On-premises HR systems:* You can use
link:/microsoft-identity-manager/microsoft-identity-manager-2016[Microsoft
Identity Manager] to provision users from your on-premises HR systems to
Active Directory or directly to Azure AD.
** *Cloud-based HR systems:* Learn how to connect
link:/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-tutorial[SAP
SuccessFactors] and
link:/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial#planning-your-deployment[Workday]
to Azure AD.

Use this table to validate your HR-driven user provisioning.

[width="100%",cols="46%,54%",options="header",]
|===
|Test scenario |Expected results
|New employee is created in the cloud HR app |The user account is
provisioned in Azure AD and can access assigned cloud resources. If
Azure AD Connect sync is configured, the user account also gets created
in Active Directory. The user can sign into Active Directory domain apps
and perform their desired actions.

|User is terminated in the cloud HR app |The user account is disabled in
Azure AD, and, if applicable, Active Directory. The user can’t sign into
cloud or on-premises applications and resources assigned to them.

|Supervisor is updated in the cloud HR app |User remains active with the
new mapping.

|HR rehires an employee into a new role. |The results depend on how the
cloud HR app is configured to generate employee IDs. If the old employee
ID is reused for a rehire, the connector enables the existing Active
Directory account for the user. If the rehire gets a new employee ID,
the connector creates a new Active Directory account for the user.

|HR converts the employee to a contract worker or vice-versa |A new
Active Directory account is created for the new persona and the old
account is disabled on the effective date of the conversion.

more about Azure AD deployment].

==== Configure Azure AD groups

Configuring groups in Azure AD allows you to create and manage policies
and license assignments at scale.

* *Assign a unique attribute to frontline workers:* The ability to
identify all frontline workers is useful when applying groups to the
frontline workforce or for validating that integrations between Azure AD
and HR systems are functioning properly. Organizations frequently use
the Job ID attribute for this purpose. Depending on your organization’s
structure, you may also need
link:/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-overview[custom
security attributes] or
link:/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-schema-extensions[directory
extension attributes].
* *Create Azure AD groups and assign frontline users:* With Azure AD
groups, you can grant access and permissions to a group of users instead
of for each individual user. Groups are used to manage users that all
need the same access and permissions to resources, such as potentially
restricted apps and services. Instead of adding special permissions to
individual users, you create a group that applies the special
permissions to every member of that group.

The table below includes recommendations for applying groups in
frontline implementations. For more information on group types,
membership types, and assignment, see the
link:/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-learn-about-groups?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fenterprise-users%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context[Azure
AD documentation for groups and membership] and
link:/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups[managing
groups]. For more information on security group limits and other Azure
AD service limits, see
link:/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions[Azure
Active Directory Service limits and restrictions].

[width="100%",cols="45%,55%",options="header",]
|===
|Use case |Group type
|Assign licenses, policies, and permissions automatically. If a member’s
attributes change, the system looks at dynamic group rules for the
directory to see if the member meets the rule requirements (is added),
or no longer meets the rule requirements (is removed). |Security group
(limit 5,000 groups) dynamic user

|Manage access for users without automatic assignment to groups.
|Security groups or distribution list (no limit applies)

|Create an email alias to distribute groups messages to groups of users
without automatic user management. |Distribution list or assigned
Microsoft 365 group

|Create an email alias or team in Microsoft Teams and manage membership
automatically. |Microsoft 365 groups, dynamic user

|Use link:/azure/active-directory/roles/my-staff-configure[My Staff] to
delegate permissions to frontline managers to view employee profiles,
change phone numbers, and reset passwords.

the different types of groups you can create in the Microsoft 365 admin
center].

==== Assign frontline licenses

You can add licenses to individual users or to groups of users in Azure
AD. Group assignment is the most scalable way to assign licenses to your
frontline workers. You can assign one or more product licenses to a
group.

link:/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-licensing-whatis-azure-portal[Learn
more about group-based licensing] and
link:/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-groups-assign[assigning
licenses to groups].

You may need to

licenses] if you’re changing some users from E to F licenses.
link:switch-from-enterprise-to-frontline.md#switch-users-to-a-microsoft-365-f-plan[Learn
more about how to switch specific users from E to F licenses].

=== Step 4: Configure device enrollment

Registering devices in Azure AD creates a unique identity that can be
used to secure and manage devices.
link:/azure/active-directory/devices/[Learn more about Azure AD device
identity].

==== Shared device enrollment with Intune

*Android:* Automatically enroll Android devices into shared device mode
with
link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/whats-new#intune-support-for-provisioning-azure-active-directory-shared-devices[Microsoft
Endpoint Manager].
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/enroll-android-enterprise-dedicated-devices-into-azure-ad-shared/ba-p/1820093[Learn
more about enrolling shared devices in Intune].

*iOS:* Not currently available.

==== BYOD device enrollment with Intune

Use Microsoft Intune to keep your frontline workers’ devices secure and
protected. Learn more about how to enroll different types of BYOD
devices in Intune:

* link:/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods#user-self-enrollment-in-intune[Windows]
* link:/mem/intune/enrollment/android-work-profile-enroll[Android]
* link:/mem/intune/enrollment/ios-enroll#user-owned-iosipados-and-ipados-devices-byod[iOS]

==== Configuring devices for shared device mode with third-party mobile device management

Zero-touch provisioning of shared device mode isn’t currently supported
by third-party mobile device management(MDM) solutions. However, you can
link:/azure/active-directory/develop/tutorial-v2-shared-device-mode#set-up-an-android-device-in-shared-mode[manually
configure shared device mode] for Android and iOS devices managed in
third-party MDM solutions.

____
[!NOTE] While these steps register the device in Azure AD, they don’t
connect Azure AD to the MDM solution. Conditional access won’t be
available for these devices.

more about configuration with VMware Workspace ONE] and
https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v15.0/en/console/configurations/advancedconfigurations/shareddevice/shareddevice.html[SOTI].

If you choose to manually configure devices in shared device mode,
you’ll need to take more steps to re-enroll Android devices in shared
device mode when third-party MDM support is available by uninstalling
and reinstalling Authenticator from the device.

To set up shared and personal devices to work with Microsoft 365 and
Microsoft Teams and to allow your frontline workers to communicate more
securely within your organization, see link:flw-devices.md[Manage mobile
devices for frontline workers].

=== Step 5: Set up other services

Depending on your scenarios, you’ll need to configure additional
Microsoft 365 services, such as Exchange and Outlook for email or
Microsoft Viva to expand your employee experience. Read on for
information about each service.

==== Set up email with Exchange Online

If you want your frontline managers and workers to have access to email,
you need to set up email in Microsoft 365. Users must have an F3 license
to get access to email. Follow the https://aka.ms/office365setup[Email
setup guide] to set it up.

Your users can also install the Outlook app to use for their email, so
you’ll want to make sure you share where to download the Outlook app
with them.

===== Outlook

Using dynamic group backed shared mailboxes based on attributes such as
Location, Department, and Role enables your organization to send
targeted communications to dynamic groups that don’t require
administrator intervention.

==== Set up sites with SharePoint in Microsoft 365

link:/sharepoint/sharepoint-online[SharePoint] lets you share documents
and create sites. Use the https://aka.ms/spoguidance[SharePoint setup
guide] in the Microsoft 365 admin center to set it up.

==== Set up Microsoft Teams

For a pilot project, you can use the Frontline worker onboarding wizard
to set up a single team, configured for your frontline workers. For
step-by-step guidance, see link:flw-onboarding-wizard.md[Use the
Frontline Worker onboarding wizard to get your frontline workforce up
and running].

For full deployments, follow the guidance in
link:deploy-teams-at-scale.md[Deploy Teams at scale for frontline
workers].

==== Set up employee experiences with Microsoft Viva

link:/viva/microsoft-viva-overview[Microsoft Viva] helps connect
employees with an integrated employee experience that brings together
communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights into the
flow of work. Microsoft Viva has several modules that can be used with
Microsoft Teams to create employee experiences.

===== Set up Viva Connections

Use link:/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview[Viva Connections]
to create a dashboard that helps engage and inform your frontline
workers. Viva Connections is a customizable app in Microsoft Teams that
gives everyone a personalized destination to discover relevant news,
conversations, and the tools they need to succeed.

Follow the https://aka.ms/EmployeeExperienceDashboard[Build your
employee experience setup guide] to set it up. Learn more about
link:/viva/connections/guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections[setting up
Viva Connections].

===== Set up Viva Learning

link:/viva/learning/[Viva Learning] is an app in Microsoft Teams that
empowers employees to make learning a natural part of the day by
bringing learning into the flow of work within the tools and platforms
they already use. See link:/viva/learning/set-up-viva-learning[Set up
Microsoft Viva Learning in the Teams admin center] to learn how to set
up Viva Learning.

===== Set up your organization’s social network with Viva Engage

link:/viva/engage/overview[Viva Engage] helps connect your workforce
across your company. Learn how to link:/viva/engage/setup[Set up Viva
Engage] to set it up.

==== Set up Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI

You can use all of these apps within Microsoft Teams. For more
information about how to set them up, see:

* link:/powerapps/teams/overview[Power Apps and Microsoft Teams
integration]
* link:/power-automate/teams/overview[Power Automate - use flows in
Microsoft Teams]
* link:/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-collaborate-microsoft-teams[Collaborate
in Microsoft Teams with Power BI]
* link:/power-virtual-agents/teams/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents-teams[Power
Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams]
* link:/microsoftteams/manage-power-platform-apps[Power Apps]

=== Step 6: Configure security

After provisioning users, enrolling your devices, and configuring your
applications, you’re now ready to create policies to secure your
organization’s infrastructure resources.

* *Conditional access:* Plan an
link:/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access[Azure
Active Directory conditional access deployment].
* *App protection policies:* link:/mem/intune/apps/app-management[Learn
about app management in Microsoft Intune].
* *Multi-factor authentication:* Require
link:/mem/intune/enrollment/multi-factor-authentication[multi-factor
authentication for Intune device enrollment].

Once you’re done setting up security policies, it’s important for you to
use a test user (non-admin) account to verify the policies work as
expected, and to ensure that the end-user experience is right for your
frontline workforce’s needs. Some capabilities like multi-factor
authentication and app protection policies can add additional steps to
device enrollment or sign-on flows, which may not be acceptable for some
frontline scenarios.

=== Step 7: Configure apps for your scenario

After everything is set up and configured in the admin center, you can
follow the guidance for your scenarios to further configure the apps you
need for each scenario.

Follow these best practices to set up Microsoft Teams for your frontline
workforce.

*Policy packages* are a collection of predefined policies and policy
settings that you can assign to users who have similar roles in your
organization. Policy packages simplify, streamline, and help provide
consistency when managing policies. Teams provides
link:/microsoftteams/policy-packages-flw[predefined policy packages] for
frontline workers and managers. You can also create a custom policy
package and assign them to your frontline workers at scale in the Teams
admin center.

Use *team templates* in the Teams admin center or by using PowerShell.
You can use prebuilt templates or
link:/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console#create-your-own-team-templates[create
your own]. You can also apply template policies to control which
templates are available to your users in Teams. Learn more about
link:/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console[how
to get started with team templates in the Teams admin center] and
link:/microsoft-365/frontline/deploy-teams-at-scale?#set-up-and-deploy-your-teams[how
to set up and deploy teams]. A prebuilt frontline template is accessible
from the Teams admin center with the template ID
``com.microsoft.teams.template.Frontline''.

The table below shows Teams applications commonly utilized in frontline
solutions. Shifts, Approvals, and Walkie Talkie are present in the Teams
mobile client out of the box. You can control which applications are
available to all users in the Teams admin center.
