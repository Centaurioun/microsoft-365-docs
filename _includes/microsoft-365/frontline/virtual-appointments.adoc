=== The Virtual Appointments app

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:includes/preview-feature.md[preview-feature]]

The Virtual Appointments app provides a central hub for all your virtual
appointment needs. The app enables a seamless end-to-end experience for
business-to-customer engagements, integrating schedules from the
Bookings app, analytics, and management options, all in one place.

You can schedule, view, and manage virtual appointments, get real-time
status updates in a queue view, send appointment reminders, view
analytics and reports to gain insight into virtual appointments
activity, and configure calendar, staff, and booking page settings.

With any Microsoft 365 license, you can use basic Virtual Appointments
capabilities that make it easy to schedule and join business-to-customer
meetings. For example, you can schedule appointments in the Bookings
calendar and external attendees can link:browser-join.md[join through a

=== The Bookings app

The
https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-bookings-42d4e852-8e99-4d8f-9b70-d7fc93973cb5[Bookings
app] in Teams offers a simple way to schedule and manage virtual
appointments. Use it to schedule virtual appointments such as financial
consultations, healthcare visits, interviews, customer support, virtual
fittings and consultations, and education office hours.

Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well
as communications with internal and external attendees.

Each scheduled virtual appointment contains a Teams meeting link thatâ€™s
sent to attendees in email where they can easily join from a browser or
in Teams on any device.

With any Microsoft 365 license, you can use basic Virtual Appointments
capabilities that make it easy to schedule and join business-to-customer
meetings. For example, attendees can wait in a pre-appointment waiting
room and link:browser-join.md[join through a browser] without having to
download Teams. With
link:/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams[Teams
Premium] (Preview), your organization gets advanced Virtual Appointments
capabilities on top of Bookings to manage and personalize the
experience. These include a queue view of scheduled and on-demand
appointments, SMS text notifications, custom waiting rooms, and
analytics.

=== Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector

If your healthcare organization uses an EHR system, you can use the
Teams EHR connector to integrate Teams for a more seamless virtual care
experience. The Teams EHR connector requires an active subscription to
Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare or a subscription to Microsoft Teams EHR
connector standalone offer.

After you set up the Teams EHR connector, clinicians can launch visits
with patients and consultations with other providers in Teams directly
from the EHR system.

Currently, the Teams EHR connector supports integration with the Cerner
EHR system and Epic EHR system. To learn more, see:

into Cerner EHR]
* link:ehr-admin-epic.md[Virtual appointments with Teams - Integration
into Epic EHR]

=== Virtual appointment meeting template

The Virtual appointment template is a default meeting template in Teams
that your users can use to schedule virtual appointments with customers,
clients and other people outside your organization. The template allows
you to specify values for meeting settings that meeting organizers
typically control. Use it to apply default settings and enforce
settings.

With this template, you can enable a consistent experience across your
organization for virtual appointments scheduled directly within Teams
and help enforce compliance requirements.

To learn more, see
link:/microsoftteams/virtual-appointment-meeting-template[Virtual
appointment meeting template in Teams].

=== Virtual Appointment Graph API

Developers can programmatically create and manage Virtual Appointments
using Microsoft Graph. With the Virtual Appointment Graph API, virtual
appointment join links can be embedded in any app, with features that
include a waiting room and browser join experience for external
attendees.

link:/graph/api/resources/virtualappointment?view=graph-rest-beta[virtualAppointment
