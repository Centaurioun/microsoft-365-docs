==== Virtual Appointments basics

*What is a virtual appointment?*

A virtual appointment is an online appointment conducted over Microsoft
Teams. You’ll be speaking one-on-one with one of our staff members, just
like you would for an in-person visit.

*How are virtual appointments different than in-person visits?*

Let your customers know if there are differences in the services you
provide virtually and in person. You can also describe any fee
differences between virtual and in-person appointments.

*How does a virtual appointment go?*

When you join from the link in the email confirmation, you’ll enter a
virtual waiting room. Once a staff member joins the call, you’ll enter a
virtual room with them where your one-on-one visit will take place.

*How does payment work for virtual appointments?*

Let your customers know if you accept different types of payment for
virtual Appointments.

==== Booking an appointment

*How do I make an appointment?*

Link to your organization’s booking page. Let your customers know if
there are alternative ways of making virtual appointments, such as over
the phone, through email, or through social media.

*Who can I make an appointment with?*

Make sure your clients can maintain relationships with their preferred
providers by sharing which, if any, staff members are operating
exclusively virtually or in-person.

*How do I cancel or reschedule a virtual appointment?*

You can link to your organization’s cancellation and rescheduling policy
here, or describe any differences in the policy between virtual and
in-person appointments.

==== Technology

*What equipment do I need for a virtual appointment?*

Customers can join a virtual appointment from any web browser or through
the Microsoft Teams app. List here if your organization has additional
specifications, such as a high-quality webcam or microphone. If your
healthcare organization has integrated your Electronic Health Record
(EHR) system with Teams, patients can join visits from your healthcare
portal.
