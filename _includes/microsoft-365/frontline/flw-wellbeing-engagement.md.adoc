== Engage your frontline workers and focus on wellbeing

Nurture a sense of belonging among your frontline team by empowering to engage with your entire organization.

Survey's like Microsoft's https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index[Work Trend Index Pulse Report] show that many frontline workers:

* Wish more was being done to support their mental health
* Say leadership does not prioritize building culture
* Believe that work stress will either stay the same or worsen in the coming year

You can help your frontline team overcome these challenges and feel supported in your organization by using <<connect-frontline-workers-to-your-broader-organization-with-viva-connections,Viva Connections>>, <<create-communities-with-yammer,Yammer>>, <<boost-morale-with-praise,Praise>>, <<support-engagement-with-sharepoint-and-microsoft-stream,SharePoint, and Microsoft Stream>>.

=== Support engagement with SharePoint and Microsoft Stream

One of the biggest struggles for frontline workers is feeling included in the broader organization.
By recording important meetings in SharePoint and hosting videos in Microsoft Stream.

==== Record Teams meetings and store them in SharePoint

If your organization already uses Microsoft Teams, you may have recorded some of your meetings so that team members can catch up on meetings that they missed.
Recording meetings can also benefit your frontline team by making them feel included in the organization.
Some ways you can use recorded meetings to help frontline teams include:

* Give them earlier access to announcements such as product releases and new policies.
* Help them understand your organization's broader business goals.
* Familiarize them with the leadership team that drives decisions that affect them.

Once a meeting is recorded and saved in SharePoint, your corporate communications team can link:/viva/connections/create-dashboard#create-a-dashboard-and-add-cards[add a card in Viva Connections] to make it easily accessible for your frontline team.

==== Host live events and share video content on Microsoft Stream

Microsoft Stream is your organization's own streaming video platform.
With Stream, anyone in your organization can record and upload videos to share.
Ways you can use Stream to engage your frontline workers include:

* Share announcements such as product releases and new policies so your frontline team isn't the last to know.
* Members of the leadership team can introduce themselves and discuss their goals so your frontline team understands who drives decisions and why.
* Frontline teams from different locations can create videos introducing themselves and showcasing their location so workers in different places can feel connected.
