== Create a Microsoft 365 group with a specific preferred data location

When users in a multi-geo environment create a Microsoft 365 group, the
group preferred data location (PDL) is automatically set to that of the
user. Global, SharePoint, and Exchange Administrators can create groups
in any _Geography_ they select.

If you need to create a group with a specific PDL, you can do that using
from the SharePoint admin center or through the Exchange Online
New-UnifiedGroup Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet. When you do this, both the
group mailbox and SharePoint site associated with the group will be
provisioned in the specified PDL.

To create a Microsoft 365 group with the PDL that you specify, go to the
SharePoint admin center in the _Geography_ location where you want to
create the group site.

For example:

If you want to create a group site in your Australia location, you can
go to
`https://ContosoAUS-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/siteManagement`

[arabic]
. Select *+ Create*.
. Follow the process to create a group site.

Your group site will be provisioned in the _Geography_ location
corresponding to the SharePoint admin center from which you initiated
the site creation request.

Using Exchange PowerShell

Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and pass the parameter
_-MailBoxRegion_ with the geo location code.

For example:

[source,powershell]
----
New-UnifiedGroup -DisplayName MultiGeoEUR -Alias "MultiGeoEUR" -AccessType Public -MailboxRegion EUR 
----

____
[!NOTE] SharePoint group site provisioning is on-demand. The site will
be provisioned the first time a group owner or member attempts to access
it.
