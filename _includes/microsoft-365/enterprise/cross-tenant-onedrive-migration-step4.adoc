=== Identify users and groups to be migrated

To ensure that OneDrive permissions are retained as part of the
migration, a mapping file needs to be created to align users from the
source tenant to the target tenant.

[arabic]
. Identify the full list of OneDrive sites that will be migrated from
the source to the target tenant.
. Prepare a complete list of users and groups that will be migrated to
the target tenant.

=== Pre-create users and groups on the target tenant

[arabic]
. Pre-create users and groups as needed in the target tenantâ€™s
directory.
. All users whose OneDrive accounts are migrating to the target tenant
must have new user identities created for them in the target tenant.
. All users whose OneDrive accounts are migrating to the target tenant
must be assigned the appropriate OneDrive license.
. Any users who remain in the source tenant but need access to resources
migrating to the target tenant should have new guest identities created
for them in the target tenant.
. Pre-created users must be added as members of any appropriate security
groups or unified groups before the OneDrive migration begins.
. If the user or group name already exists in the target tenant, create
a user or group with a different name and make a note of it for the next
step.
. We recommend that OneDrive site creations are restricted in the target
tenant to prevent users from creating OneDrive sites.
