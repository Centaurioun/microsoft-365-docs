== Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-on for your Microsoft 365 test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can be used for both Microsoft 365 for enterprise
and Office 365 Enterprise test environments._

Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-On (Seamless SSO) automatically signs in
users when they are on their PCs or devices that are connected to their
organization network. Azure AD Seamless SSO provides users with easy
access to cloud-based applications without needing any additional
on-premises components.

This article describes how to configure your Microsoft 365 test
environment for Azure AD Seamless SSO.

Setting up Azure AD Seamless SSO involves two phases: -

=== Phase 1: Configure password hash synchronization for your Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in
link:password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md[password hash
synchronization for Microsoft 365].

Your resulting configuration looks like this:

image::../media/pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment/Phase1.png[The
simulated enterprise with password hash synchronization test
environment.]

This configuration consists of:

* A Microsoft 365 E5 trial or paid subscription.
* A simplified organization intranet connected to the internet,
consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of
an Azure virtual network.
* Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to periodically synchronize the TESTLAB
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain to the Azure AD tenant
of your Microsoft 365 subscription.

=== Phase 2: Configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 for Azure AD Seamless SSO

In this phase, configure Azure AD Connect on APP1 for Azure AD Seamless
SSO, and then verify that it works.

==== Configure Azure AD Connect on APP1

[arabic]
. From the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal], sign in with your
global administrator account, and then connect to APP1 with the TESTLAB
account.
. From the APP1 desktop, run Azure AD Connect.
. On the *Welcome page*, select *Configure*.
. On the *Additional tasks* page, select *Change user sign-in*, and then
select *Next*.
. On the *Connect to Azure AD* page, enter your global administrator
account credentials, and then select *Next*.
. On the *User sign-in* page, select *Enable single sign-on*, and then
select *Next*.
. On the *Enable single sign-on* page, select *Enter credentials*.
. In the *Windows Security* dialog box, enter *user1* and the password
of the user1 account, select *OK*, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Ready to Configure* page, select *Configure*.
. On the *Configuration complete* page, select *Exit*.
. From the Azure portal, in the left pane, select *Azure Active
Directory* > *Azure AD Connect*. Verify that the *Seamless single
sign-on* feature appears as *Enabled*.

Next, test the ability to sign in to your subscription with the
user1@testlab.<__your public domain__> user name of the User1 account.

[arabic]
. From Internet Explorer on APP1, select the settings icon, and then
select *Internet Options*.
. In *Internet Options*, select the *Security* tab.
. Select *Local intranet*, and then select *Sites*.
. In *Local intranet*, select *Advanced*.
. In *Add this website to the zone*, enter
*https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com*, select *Add* > *Close* >
*OK* > *OK*.
. Sign out, and then sign in again, this time specifying a different
account.
. When prompted to sign in, specify user1@testlab.<__your public
domain__> name, and then select *Next*. You should successfully sign in
as User1 without being prompted for a password. This proves that Azure
AD Seamless SSO is working.

Notice that although User1 has domain administrator permissions for the
TESTLAB AD DS domain, it is not a global administrator for Azure AD.
Therefore, you will not see the *Admin* icon as an option.

Here is your resulting configuration:

image::../media/pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment/Phase1.png[The
simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication test environment.]

This configuration consists of:

* A Microsoft 365 E5 trial or paid subscriptions with the DNS domain
testlab.<__your domain name__> registered.
* A simplified organization intranet connected to the internet,
consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of
an Azure virtual network.
* Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize the list of accounts and
groups from the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 subscription to
the TESTLAB AD DS domain.
* Azure AD Seamless SSO is enabled so that computers on the simulated
intranet can sign in to Microsoft 365 cloud resources without specifying
a user account password.
