== Messages Pending Delivery to External Recipients Outside of Exchange Online

This advisory informs you of mail queuing to external recipients outside
of Exchange Online. Many of these advisories require actions outside of
Microsoft and provide administrators with the information needed to
remediate.

These advisories are displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To
view these advisories, go to *Health* > *Service health* > *Exchange
Online* and then click the *Active issues* tab. The name for these
service alerts is ``Message Queueing to External Recipients Above
Thresholds''.

following is displayed.

=== What do these service advisories indicate?

This service advisory informs you of messages destined to recipients
outside Exchange Online may be delayed. Queueing may be caused by your
on-premises environment or third-party messagingsolution. Reasons for
queueing may be caused by, but are not limited to:

* DNS changes
* Excessive sending rates
* MTAsolutions with low to no free disk space
* Certificate issues

Each service advisory contains high level recommendations for
administrators in remediating the issue. We also provide the number of
messages queued at the time of alert, the domain where the messages are
queued to, and the SMTP error code associated with most messages.

For more information for determining the root cause for these service
alerts, see
link:../security/office-365-security/connectors-mail-flow-intelligence.md[Mail
flow intelligence in Exchange Online]. This article also includes
suggested actions to fix the root cause.

____
[!NOTE] As Microsoft cannot account for every SMTP error code provided
by third-party vendors, administrators may be required to investigate
these errors codes specific to their Message Transfer Agent (MTA) or
journaling solutions.
