== Identity and device access prerequisites for pass-through authentication in your Microsoft 365 test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise
test environments._

link:../security/office-365-security/microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md[Identity
and device access configurations] are a set of configurations and
conditional access policies to protect access to all services in
Microsoft 365 for enterprise that are integrated with Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD).

This article describes how you can configure a Microsoft 365 test
environment that meets the requirements of the
link:../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites[Pass-through
authentication prerequisite configuration] for identity and device
access.

There are ten phases to setting up this test environment:

[arabic]
. Build out your simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication
Microsoft 365 test environment
. Configure Azure AD seamless single sign-on
. Configure named locations
. Configure password writeback
. Configure self-service password reset
. Configure multifactor authentication
. Enable automatic device registration of domain-joined Windows
computers
. Configure Azure AD password protection
. Enable Azure AD Identity Protection
. Enable modern authentication for Exchange Online and Skype for
Business Online

=== Phase 1: Build out your simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in
link:pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md[Pass-through
authentication].

Here is the resulting configuration.

simulated enterprise with pass-through authentication test environment.]

=== Phase 2: Configure Azure AD seamless single sign-on

Follow the instructions in
link:single-sign-on-m365-ent-test-environment.md#phase-2-configure-azure-ad-connect-on-app1-for-azure-ad-seamless-sso[Phase
2 of the Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-on Test Lab Guide].

=== Phase 3: Configure named locations

First, determine the public IP addresses or address ranges used by your
organization.

Next, follow the instructions in
link:/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations[Configure
named locations in Azure Active Directory] to add the addresses or
address ranges as named locations.

=== Phase 4: Configure password writeback

Follow the instructions in
link:password-writeback-m365-ent-test-environment.md#phase-2-enable-password-writeback-for-the-testlab-ad-ds-domain[Phase
2 of the password writeback Test Lab Guide].

=== Phase 5: Configure self-service password reset

Follow the instructions in
link:password-reset-m365-ent-test-environment.md#phase-3-configure-and-test-password-reset[Phase
3 of the password reset Test Lab Guide].

When enabling password reset for the accounts in a specific Azure AD
group, add these accounts to the *Password reset* group:

* User 2
* User 3
* User 4
* User 5

Test password reset only for the User 2 account.

=== Phase 6: Configure multi-factor authentication

Follow the instructions in
link:multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365-test-environment.md#phase-2-enable-and-test-multi-factor-authentication-for-the-user-2-account[Phase
2 of the multi-factor authentication Test Lab Guide] for the following
user accounts:

* User 2
* User 3
* User 4
* User 5

Test multi-factor authentication only for the User 2 account.

=== Phase 7: Enable automatic device registration of domain-joined Windows computers

Follow
link:/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-plan[these
instructions] to enable automatic device registration of domain-joined
Windows computers.

=== Phase 8: Configure Azure AD password protection

Follow
link:/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad[these
instructions] to block known weak passwords and their variants.

=== Phase 9: Enable Azure AD Identity Protection

Follow the instructions in
link:azure-ad-identity-protection-microsoft-365-test-environment.md#phase-2-use-azure-ad-identity-protection[Phase
2 of the Azure AD Identity Protection Test Lab Guide].

=== Phase 10: Enable modern authentication for Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online

For Exchange Online, follow
link:/Exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online#enable-or-disable-modern-authentication-in-exchange-online-for-client-connections-in-outlook-2013-or-later[these
instructions].

For Skype for Business Online:

[arabic]
. Connect to
link:/SkypeForBusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell[Skype
for Business Online].
. Run this command.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-CsOAuthConfiguration -ClientAdalAuthOverride Allowed
----

[arabic, start=3]
. Verify that the change was successful with this command.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-CsOAuthConfiguration
----

The result is a test environment that meets the requirements of the
link:../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md#prerequisites[Pass-through
authentication prerequisite configuration] for identity and device
access.

=== Next step

Use
link:../security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md[Common
identity and device access policies] to configure the policies that
build on the prerequisites and protect identities and devices.
