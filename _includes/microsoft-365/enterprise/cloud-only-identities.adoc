== Microsoft 365 cloud-only identity

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365
Enterprise._

If you have chosen the cloud-only identity model, you already have an
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant for your Microsoft 365
subscription to store all of your users, groups, and contacts. After
setting up protection for administrator accounts in
link:protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md[Step 2] and user
accounts in link:microsoft-365-secure-sign-in.md[Step 3] of this
solution, you are now ready to begin creating the new accounts and
groups that your organization needs.

Here are the basic components of cloud-only identity.

Users and their user accounts in organizations can be categorized in a
number of ways. For example, some are employees and have a permanent
status. Some are vendors, contractors, or partners that have a temporary
status. Some are external users that have no user accounts but must
still be granted access to specific services and resources to support
interaction and collaboration. For example:

* Tenant accounts represent users within your organization that you
license for cloud services
* Business to Business (B2B) accounts represent users outside your
organization that you invite to participate in collaboration

Take stock of the types of users in your organization. What are the
groupings? For example, you can group users by high-level function or
purpose to your organization.

Additionally, some cloud services can be shared with users outside your
organization without any user accounts. You’ll need to identify these
groups of users as well.

You can use groups in Azure AD for several purposes that simplify
management of your cloud environment. For example, with Azure AD groups,
you can:

* Use group-based licensing to assign licenses for Microsoft 365 to your
user accounts automatically as soon as they are added as members.
* Add user accounts to specific groups dynamically based on user account
attributes, such as department name.
* Automatically provision users for Software as a Service (SaaS)
applications and to protect access to those applications with
multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other Conditional Access policies.
* Provision permissions and levels of access for teams and SharePoint
Online team sites.
