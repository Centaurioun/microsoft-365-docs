== Networking roadmap for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes collaboration and productivity
cloud services, Microsoft Intune, and many identity and security
services of Microsoft Azure. All of these cloud-based services rely on
the security, performance, and reliability of connections from client
devices over the Internet or dedicated circuits. To host these services
and make them available to customers all over the world, Microsoft has
designed a networking infrastructure that emphasizes performance and
integration.

A crucial part of your Microsoft 365 onboarding is to ensure that your
network and Internet connections are set up for optimized access.
Configuring your on-premises network to access a globally distributed
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud is different from a traditional
network that is optimized for traffic to on-premises datacenters and a
central Internet connection.

Use these articles to understand the key differences and to modify your
edge devices, client computers, and on-premises network to get the best
performance for your on-premises users.

=== Plan

In the planning phase of your networking implementation:

connectivity]
* link:plan-for-network-devices.md[Plan for your network devices]
* link:network-and-migration-planning.md[Get your network set up for
migration]

=== Deploy

In the deployment phase of your networking implementation:

=== Network equipment vendors

If you are a network equipment vendor, join the
link:microsoft-365-networking-partner-program.md[Microsoft 365
Networking Partner Program]. Enroll in the program to build Microsoft
365 network connectivity principles into your products and solutions.

=== How Contoso did networking for Microsoft 365

See how the Contoso Corporation, a fictional but representative
multi-national business, link:contoso-networking.md[optimized their
network devices and Internet connections] for Microsoft 365 cloud
services.
