== Federated identity for your Microsoft 365 test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can be used for both Microsoft 365 for enterprise
and Office 365 Enterprise test environments._

Microsoft 365 supports federated identity. This means that instead of
performing the validation of credentials itself, Microsoft 365 refers
the connecting user to a federated authentication server that Microsoft
365 trusts. If the user’s credentials are correct, the federated
authentication server issues a security token that the client then sends
to Microsoft 365 as proof of authentication. Federated identity allows
for the offloading and scaling up of authentication for a Microsoft 365
subscription and advanced authentication and security scenarios.

This article describes how to configure federated authentication for
your Microsoft 365 test environment, resulting in the following:

image::../media/federated-identity-for-your-microsoft-365-dev-test-environment/federated-tlg-phase3.png[The
federated authentication for Microsoft 365 test environment.]

This configuration consists of:

* A Microsoft 365 E5 trial or production subscription.
* A simplified organization intranet connected to the internet,
consisting of five virtual machines on a subnet of an Azure virtual
network (DC1, APP1, CLIENT1, ADFS1, and PROXY1). Azure AD Connect runs
on APP1 to synchronize the list of accounts in the Active Directory
Domain Services domain to Microsoft 365. PROXY1 receives the incoming
authentication requests. ADFS1 validates credentials with DC1 and issues
security tokens.

Setting up this test environment involves five phases: -

[!NOTE] You can’t configure this test environment with an Azure Trial
subscription.
____

=== Phase 1: Configure password hash synchronization for your Microsoft 365 test environment

Follow the instructions in
link:password-hash-sync-m365-ent-test-environment.md[password hash
synchronization for Microsoft 365]. Your resulting configuration looks
like this:

image::../media/federated-identity-for-your-microsoft-365-dev-test-environment/federated-tlg-phase1.png[The
simulated enterprise with password hash synchronization test
environment.]

This configuration consists of:

* A Microsoft 365 E5 trial or paid subscriptions.
* A simplified organization intranet connected to the internet,
consisting of the DC1, APP1, and CLIENT1 virtual machines on a subnet of
an Azure virtual network. Azure AD Connect runs on APP1 to synchronize
the TESTLAB Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain to the Azure
AD tenant of your Microsoft 365 subscriptions periodically.

=== Phase 2: Create the AD FS server

An AD FS server provides federated authentication between Microsoft 365
and the accounts in the corp.contoso.com domain hosted on DC1.

To create an Azure virtual machine for ADFS1, fill in the name of your
subscription and the resource group and Azure location for your Base
Configuration, and then run these commands at the Azure PowerShell
command prompt on your local computer.

[source,powershell]
----
$subscrName="<your Azure subscription name>"
$rgName="<the resource group name of your Base Configuration>"
$vnetName="TlgBaseConfig-01-VNET"
# NOTE: If you built your simulated intranet with Azure PowerShell, comment the previous line with a "#" and remove the "#" from the next line.
#$vnetName="TestLab"
Connect-AzAccount
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName $subscrName
$staticIP="10.0.0.100"
$locName=(Get-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName).Location
$vnet=Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name ADFS1-PIP -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -AllocationMethod Dynamic

$vm=New-AzVMConfig -VMName ADFS1 -VMSize Standard_D2_v2
$cred=Get-Credential -Message "Type the name and password of the local administrator account for ADFS1."
$vm=Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vm -Windows -ComputerName ADFS1 -Credential $cred -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate
$vm=Set-AzVMSourceImage -VM $vm -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer -Skus 2016-Datacenter -Version "latest"
$vm=Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id

New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -VM $vm
----

Next, use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the
ADFS1 virtual machine using the ADFS1 local administrator account name
and password, and then open a Windows PowerShell command prompt.

To check name resolution and network communication between ADFS1 and
DC1, run the *ping dc1.corp.contoso.com* command and check that there
are four replies.

Next, join the ADFS1 virtual machine to the CORP domain with these
commands at the Windows PowerShell prompt on ADFS1.

[source,powershell]
----
$cred=Get-Credential -UserName "CORP\User1" -Message "Type the User1 account password."
Add-Computer -DomainName corp.contoso.com -Credential $cred
Restart-Computer
----

Your resulting configuration looks like this:

image::../media/federated-identity-for-your-microsoft-365-dev-test-environment/federated-tlg-phase2.png[The
AD FS server added to the DirSync for Microsoft 365 test environment.]

=== Phase 3: Create the web proxy server

PROXY1 provides proxying of authentication messages between users trying
to authenticate and ADFS1.

To create an Azure virtual machine for PROXY1, fill in the name of your
resource group and Azure location, and then run these commands at the
Azure PowerShell command prompt on your local computer.

[source,powershell]
----
$rgName="<the resource group name of your Base Configuration>"
$vnetName="TlgBaseConfig-01-VNET"
# NOTE: If you built your simulated intranet with Azure PowerShell, comment the previous line with a "#" and remove the "#" from the next line.
#$vnetName="TestLab"
$staticIP="10.0.0.101"
$locName=(Get-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName).Location
$vnet=Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name PROXY1-PIP -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -AllocationMethod Static
$nic = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name PROXY1-NIC -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id -PrivateIpAddress $staticIP
$vm=New-AzVMConfig -VMName PROXY1 -VMSize Standard_D2_v2
$cred=Get-Credential -Message "Type the name and password of the local administrator account for PROXY1."
$vm=Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $vm -Windows -ComputerName PROXY1 -Credential $cred -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate
$vm=Set-AzVMSourceImage -VM $vm -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer -Offer WindowsServer -Skus 2016-Datacenter -Version "latest"
$vm=Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id
$vm=Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name "PROXY1-OS" -DiskSizeInGB 128 -CreateOption FromImage -StorageAccountType "Standard_LRS"
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -VM $vm
----

____
[!NOTE] PROXY1 is assigned a static public IP address because you will
create a public DNS record that points to it and it must not change when
you restart the PROXY1 virtual machine.
____

Next, add a rule to the network security group for the CorpNet subnet to
allow unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet to PROXY1’s private
IP address and TCP port 443. Run these commands at the Azure PowerShell
command prompt on your local computer.

[source,powershell]
----
$rgName="<the resource group name of your Base Configuration>"
Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name CorpNet -ResourceGroupName $rgName | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "HTTPS-to-PROXY1" -Description "Allow TCP 443 to PROXY1" -Access "Allow" -Protocol "Tcp" -Direction "Inbound" -Priority 101 -SourceAddressPrefix "Internet" -SourcePortRange "*" -DestinationAddressPrefix "10.0.0.101" -DestinationPortRange "443" | Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup
----

Next, use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the
PROXY1 virtual machine using the PROXY1 local administrator account name
and password, and then open a Windows PowerShell command prompt on
PROXY1.

To check name resolution and network communication between PROXY1 and
DC1, run the *ping dc1.corp.contoso.com* command and check that there
are four replies.

Next, join the PROXY1 virtual machine to the CORP domain with these
commands at the Windows PowerShell prompt on PROXY1.

[source,powershell]
----
$cred=Get-Credential -UserName "CORP\User1" -Message "Type the User1 account password."
Add-Computer -DomainName corp.contoso.com -Credential $cred
Restart-Computer
----

Display the public IP address of PROXY1 with these Azure PowerShell
commands on your local computer.

[source,powershell]
----
Write-Host (Get-AzPublicIpaddress -Name "PROXY1-PIP" -ResourceGroup $rgName).IPAddress
----

Next, work with your public DNS provider and create a new public DNS A
record for **fs.testlab.**<__your DNS domain name__> that resolves to
the IP address displayed by the *Write-Host* command. The
**fs.testlab.**<__your DNS domain name__> is hereafter referred to as
the _federation service FQDN_.

Next, use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the
DC1 virtual machine using the CORP\User1 credentials, and then run the
following commands at an administrator-level Windows PowerShell command
prompt:

[source,powershell]
----
Add-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name corp.contoso.com -ZoneFile corp.contoso.com.dns
Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name "fs" -ZoneName corp.contoso.com -AllowUpdateAny -IPv4Address "10.0.0.100" -TimeToLive 01:00:00
----

These commands create an internal DNS A record so that virtual machines
on the Azure virtual network can resolve the internal federation service
FQDN to ADFS1’s private IP address.

Your resulting configuration looks like this:

image::../media/federated-identity-for-your-microsoft-365-dev-test-environment/federated-tlg-phase3.png[The
web application proxy server added to the DirSync for Microsoft 365 test
environment.]

=== Phase 4: Create a self-signed certificate and configure ADFS1 and PROXY1

In this phase, you create a self-signed digital certificate for your
federation service FQDN and configure ADFS1 and PROXY1 as an AD FS farm.

First, use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the
DC1 virtual machine using the CORP\User1 credentials, and then open an
administrator-level Windows PowerShell command prompt.

Next, create an AD FS service account with this command at the Windows
PowerShell command prompt on DC1:

[source,powershell]
----
New-ADUser -SamAccountName ADFS-Service -AccountPassword (read-host "Set user password" -assecurestring) -name "ADFS-Service" -enabled $true -PasswordNeverExpires $true -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false
----

Note that this command prompts you to supply the account password.
Choose a strong password and record it in a secured location. You will
need it for this phase and for Phase 5.

Use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the ADFS1
virtual machine using the CORP\User1 credentials. Open an
administrator-level Windows PowerShell command prompt on ADFS1, fill in
your federation service FQDN, and then run these commands to create a
self-signed certificate:

[source,powershell]
----
$fedServiceFQDN="<federation service FQDN>"
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName $fedServiceFQDN -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
New-Item -path c:\Certs -type directory
New-SmbShare -name Certs -path c:\Certs -changeaccess CORP\User1
----

Next, use these steps to save the new self-signed certificate as a file.

=== Phase 5: Configure Microsoft 365 for federated identity

Use the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] to connect to the APP1
virtual machine with the CORP\User1 account credentials.

Use these steps to configure Azure AD Connect and your Microsoft 365
subscription for federated authentication:

[arabic]
. From the desktop, double-click *Azure AD Connect*.
. On the *Welcome to Azure AD Connect* page, select *Configure*.
. On the *Additional tasks* page, select *Change user sign-in*, and then
select *Next*.
. On the *Connect to Azure AD* page, enter your global administrator
account name and password, and then select *Next*.
. On the *User sign-in* page, select *Federation with AD FS*, and then
select *Next*.
. On the *AD FS farm* page, select *Use an existing AD FS farm*, enter
*ADFS1* in the *Server Name* box, and then select *Next*.
. When prompted for server credentials, enter the credentials of the
CORP\User1 account, and then select *OK*.
. On the *Domain Administrator* credentials page, enter *CORP\User1* in
the *Username* box, enter the account password in the *Password* box,
and then select *Next*.
. On the *AD FS service account* page, enter *CORP\ADFS-Service* in the
*Domain Username* box, enter the account password in the *Domain User
Password* box, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Azure AD Domain* page, in *Domain*, select the name of the
domain that you previously created and added to your subscription in
Phase 1, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Ready to configure* page, select *Configure*.
. On the *Installation complete* page, select *Verify*.
+
You should see messages indicating that both the intranet and internet
configuration was verified.
. On the *Installation complete* page, select *Exit*.

To demonstrate that federated authentication is working:

[arabic]
. Open a new private instance of your browser on your local computer and
go to https://admin.microsoft.com.
. For the sign-in credentials, enter **user1@**<__the domain created in
Phase 1__>.
+
For example, if your test domain is *testlab.contoso.com*, you would
enter ``user1@testlab.contoso.com''. Press the *Tab* key or allow
Microsoft 365 to automatically redirect you.
+
You should now see a *Your connection is not private* page. You are
seeing this because you installed a self-signed certificate on ADFS1
that your desktop computer can’t validate. In a production deployment of
federated authentication, you would use a certificate from a trusted
certification authority and your users would not see this page.
. On the *Your connection is not private* page, select *Advanced*, and
then select *Proceed to <__your federation service FQDN__>*.
. On the page with the name of your fictional organization, sign in with
the following:

* *CORP\User1* for the name
* The password for the User1 account
+
You should see the *Microsoft Office Home* page.

This procedure demonstrates that your trial subscription is federated
with the AD DS corp.contoso.com domain hosted on DC1. Here are the
basics of the authentication process:

[arabic]
. When you use the federated domain that you created in Phase 1 within
the sign-in account name, Microsoft 365 redirects your browser to your
federation service FQDN and PROXY1.
. PROXY1 sends your local computer the fictional company sign-in page.
. When you send CORP\User1 and the password to PROXY1, it forwards them
to ADFS1.
. ADFS1 validates CORP\User1 and the password with DC1 and sends your
local computer a security token.
. Your local computer sends the security token to Microsoft 365.
. Microsoft 365 validates that the security token was created by ADFS1
and allows access.

Your trial subscription is now configured with federated authentication.
You can use this dev/test environment for advanced authentication
scenarios.
