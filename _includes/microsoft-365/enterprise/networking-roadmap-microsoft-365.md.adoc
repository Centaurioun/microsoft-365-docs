== Networking roadmap for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes collaboration and productivity cloud services, Microsoft Intune, and many identity and security services of Microsoft Azure.
All of these cloud-based services rely on the security, performance, and reliability of connections from client devices over the Internet or dedicated circuits.
To host these services and make them available to customers all over the world, Microsoft has designed a networking infrastructure that emphasizes performance and integration.

A crucial part of your Microsoft 365 onboarding is to ensure that your network and Internet connections are set up for optimized access.
Configuring your on-premises network to access a globally distributed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud is different from a traditional network that is optimized for traffic to on-premises datacenters and a central Internet connection.

Use these articles to understand the key differences and to modify your edge devices, client computers, and on-premises network to get the best performance for your on-premises users.
