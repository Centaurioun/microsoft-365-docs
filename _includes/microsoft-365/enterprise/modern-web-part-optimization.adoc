== Optimize web part performance in SharePoint Online modern site pages

SharePoint Online modern site pages contain web parts that can
contribute to overall page load times. This article will help you
understand how to determine how web parts in your pages affect user
perceived latency, and how to remediate common issues.

modern portals, see

=== Use the Page Diagnostics for SharePoint tool to analyze web parts

The Page Diagnostics for SharePoint tool is a browser extension for the
new Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/edge) and Chrome browsers
that analyzes both SharePoint Online modern portal and classic
publishing site pages. The tool provides a report for each analyzed page
showing how the page performs against a defined set of performance
criteria. To install and learn about the Page Diagnostics for SharePoint
tool, visit link:page-diagnostics-for-spo.md[Use the Page Diagnostics
tool for SharePoint Online].

____
[!NOTE] The Page Diagnostics tool only works for SharePoint Online, and
cannot be used on a SharePoint system page.
____

When you analyze a SharePoint site page with the Page Diagnostics for
SharePoint tool, you can see information about web parts that exceed the
baseline metric in the *Web parts are impacting page load time* result
in the _Diagnostic tests_ pane.

Possible results include:

* *Attention required* (red): Any _custom_ web part that is visible in
the viewport (screen visible portion of the page which is loaded first)
that takes longer than *two* seconds to load. Any _custom_ web parts
outside of the viewport that take longer than *four* seconds to load.
Total load time is displayed in test results and is broken down by
module load, lazy load, init and render.
* *Improvement opportunities* (yellow): Items that may be impacting page
load time are shown in this section and should be reviewed and
monitored. This may include ``out of the box'' (OOTB) Microsoft web
parts. Results for any Microsoft web parts shown in this section are
automatically reported to Microsoft, so *no action is required*. You
should only log a support ticket for investigation if you are
experiencing very slow performance on the page and *all Microsoft web
parts* on the page appear in the results in the *Improvement
opportunities* section. Note that a future Page Diagnostics for
SharePoint tool update will further break down the results based on the
specific configuration of the Microsoft web part.
* *No action required* (green): No web part is taking longer than *two*
seconds to return data.

If the *Web parts are impacting page load time* result appears in either
the *Attention required* or *Improvement opportunities* section of the
results, click the result to see details about which web parts are
loading slowly. Future updates to the Page Diagnostics for SharePoint
tool may include updates to analysis rules, so please ensure you always
have the latest version of the tool.

Diagnostics tool results.]

Information available in the results includes:

* *Made by* shows whether the web part is custom or Microsoft OOTB.
* *Name and ID* shows identifying information that can help you find the
web part on the page.
* *Total* shows the total time for the web part to module load,
initialize and render. It is the total relative time taken by the web
part to render on the page, from beginning to the end.
* *Module Load* shows the time taken to download, evaluate and load the
extensions JavaScript and CSS files. It will then start the Init
process.
* *Lazy Load* shows the time for deferred loading of web parts not seen
in the main section of the page. There are certain conditions where
there are too many web parts to render, and they are queued to render to
minimize the page load time.
* *Init* shows the time taken for the web part to initialize the data.
+
It is an asynchronous call and init time is the calculation of time for
the onInit function when the returned promise is resolved.
* *Render* shows the time taken to render the UI (user interface) once
the module load and Init are complete.
+
It is the JavaScript execution time to mount the DOM in the document
(page). Rendering of asynchronous resources, for example, images, might
take additional time to complete.

This information is provided to help designers and developers
troubleshoot issues. This information should be provided to your design
and development team.

=== Remediate web part performance issues

Follow the guidance in this section to identify and remediate
performance issues with web parts listed in the *Web parts are impacting
page load time* results.

There are three categories of possible causes for poor web part
performance. Use the information below to determine which issues apply
to your scenario and remediate them.

* Web part script size and dependencies
** Optimize the initial script that renders the mainline scenario for
_view mode only_.
** Move the less frequent scenarios and edit mode code (like the
property pane) to separate chunks using the _import()_ statement.
** Review dependencies of the _package.json_ file to remove any dead
code completely. Move any test/build only dependencies to
devDependencies.
** Use of the Office 365 CDN is required for optimal static resource
download. Public CDN origins are preferable for _js/css_ files. For more
information about using the Office 365 CDN, see
link:use-microsoft-365-cdn-with-spo.md[Use the Office 365 Content
Delivery Network (CDN) with SharePoint Online].
** Reuse frameworks like _React_ and _Fabric imports_ that come as part
of the SharePoint Framework (SPFx). For more information, see
link:/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview[Overview of the
SharePoint Framework].
** Ensure that you are using the latest version of the SharePoint
Framework, and upgrade to new versions as they become available.
* Data fetching/caching
** If the web part relies on extra server calls to fetch data for
display, ensure those server APIs are fast and/or implement client side
caching (such as using _localStorage_ or _IndexedDB_ for larger sets).
** If multiple calls are required to render critical data, consider
batching on the server or other methods of consolidating requests to a
single call.
** Alternatively, if some elements of data require a slower API, but are
not critical to initial rendering, decouple these to a separate call
that is executed after critical data is rendered.
** If multiple parts use the same data, utilize a common data layer to
avoid duplicate calls.
* Rendering time
** Any media sources like images and videos should be sized to the
limits of the container, device and/or network to avoid downloading
unnecessary large assets. For more information about content
dependencies, see link:use-microsoft-365-cdn-with-spo.md[Use the Office
365 Content Delivery Network (CDN) with SharePoint Online].
** Avoid API calls that cause re-flow, complex CSS rules or complicated
animations. For more information, see
https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/browser-reflow[Minimizing
browser reflow].
** Avoid use of chained long running tasks. Instead, break long running
tasks apart into separate queues. For more information, see
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/optimize-javascript-execution[Optimize
JavaScript Execution].
** Reserve corresponding space for asynchronously rendering media or
visual elements to avoid skipped frames and stuttering (also known as
_jank_).
** If a certain browser doesnâ€™t support a feature used in rendering,
either load a polyfill or exclude running dependent code. If the feature
is not critical, dispose resources such as event handlers to avoid
memory leaks.

Before you make page revisions to remediate performance issues, make a
note of the page load time in the analysis results. Run the tool again
after your revision to see if the new result is within the baseline
standard, and check the new page load time to see if there was an
improvement.

load time results.]

____
[!NOTE] Page load time can vary based on a variety of factors such as
network load, time of day, and other transient conditions. You should
test page load time a few times before and after making changes to help
you average the results.
