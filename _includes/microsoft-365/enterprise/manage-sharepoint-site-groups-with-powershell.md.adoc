== Manage SharePoint Online site groups with PowerShell

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise._

Although you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can also use PowerShell for Microsoft 365 to manage your SharePoint Online site groups.

=== Before you begin

The procedures in this article require you to connect to SharePoint Online.
For instructions, see link:/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online[Connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell].

=== View SharePoint Online with PowerShell for Microsoft 365

The SharePoint Online admin center has some easy-to-use methods for managing site groups.
For example, suppose you want to look at the groups, and the group members, for the `+https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance+` site.
Here's what you have to do to:

. From the SharePoint admin center, select https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185220[*Active sites*], and then select the URL of the site.
. On the site page, select https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185072[*Settings*] (located in the upper right-hand corner of the page), and then select *Site permissions*.

And then repeat the process for the next site you want to look at.

To get a list of the groups with PowerShell for Microsoft 365, you can use the following commands:

[,powershell]
----
$siteURL = "https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"
$x = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $siteURL
foreach ($y in $x)
    {
        Write-Host $y.Title -ForegroundColor "Yellow"
        Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $siteURL -Group $y.Title | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Users
        Write-Host
    }
----

There are two ways to run this command set in the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt:

* Copy the commands into Notepad (or another text editor), modify the value of the *$siteURL* variable, select the commands, and then paste them into the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt.
When you do, PowerShell will stop at a *>>* prompt.
Press Enter to execute the `foreach` command.
+
* Copy the commands into Notepad (or another text editor), modify the value of the *$siteURL* variable, and then save this text file with a name and the .ps1 extension in a suitable folder.
Next, run the script from the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt by specifying its path and file name.
Here is an example command:

[,powershell]
----
C:\Scripts\SiteGroupsAndUsers.ps1
----

In both cases, you should see something similar to this:

image::../media/SPO-site-groups.png[SharePoint Online site groups.]

These are all the groups that have been created for the site `+https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance+`, and all the users assigned to those groups.
The group names are in yellow to help you separate group names from their members.

As another example, here is a command set that lists the groups, and all the group memberships, for all of your SharePoint Online sites.

[,powershell]
----
$x = Get-SPOSite
foreach ($y in $x)
    {
        Write-Host $y.Url -ForegroundColor "Yellow"
        $z = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $y.Url
        foreach ($a in $z)
            {
                 $b = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $y.Url -Group $a.Title
                 Write-Host $b.Title -ForegroundColor "Cyan"
                 $b | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Users
                 Write-Host
            }
    }
