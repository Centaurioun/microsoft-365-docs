Now you’re ready to start your OneDrive migration. Before starting any
cross-tenant migration, do the following steps.

[arabic]
. Ensure you have verified the compatibility status. If you see a status
of either *Compatible* or *Warning* on your source tenant, you may
continue. Run:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantCompatibilityStatus –PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Target tenant hostname]
----
. To start the migration, a SharePoint Online Admin or Microsoft 365
Global Admin of the source tenant must run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove  -SourceUserPrincipalName <...> -TargetUserPrincipalName <...> -TargetCrossTenantHostUrl <...>
----

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameters |Description
|SourceUserPrincipalName |User principal name of the user who owns the
OneDrive on the Source tenant.

|TargetUserPrincipalName |User principal name of the user who owns the
OneDrive on the Target tenant.

|TargetCrossTenantHostUrl |The Cross-tenant Host URL of the target
tenant. To find the TargetCrossTenantHostUrl, run
_Get-SPOCrossTenantHostUrl_ on the tenant.
|===

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove -SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com -TargetUserPrincipalName
        Test-Diego@M365x946316.OnMicrosoft.com -TargetCrossTenantHostUrl https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com/ 
----

To Schedule a migration for a later time, you may use and append the
above command with the one of the following parameters.

These commands can be useful when planning bulk batches of OneDrive
migrations. You can queue/migrate up to 4,000 OneDrive migrations per
batch. If your user count exceeds 4,000, create separate batches, and
schedule them to run once the current batch is close to completion.

|===
|Parameter |Description
|PreferredMoveBeginDate |The migration will likely begin at this
specified time. Time must be specified in Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC).

|PreferredMoveEndDate |The migration will likely be completed by this
specified time, on a best effort basis. Time must be specified in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
|===

=== OneDrive status pre-migration

Before starting the migration, the users current source OneDrive status
will be similar to the example below. This example is from the users
source tenant, showing their current files and folders.

:::image type=``content''
source=``../media/cross-tenant-migration/t2t-onedrive-status-premigration.png''
alt-text=``pre-migration status'':::

=== Cancelling a OneDrive migration

You can stop the cross-tenant migration of a user’s OneDrive by using
the following command, provided the migration doesn’t have a status of
_In Progress_, _Rescheduled_ or _Success_.

[source,powershell]
----
Stop-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove – SourceUserPrincipalName [UPN name of user who you wish to stop]
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Stop-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove – SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com
----

=== Determining current status of a migration

After starting your migration, you can check its status using the
following command on either the source OR target tenant:

*Source command format:*

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Target URL]
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL  https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com/
----

*Target command:*

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL [Source URL]
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL  https://m365x016551-my.sharepoint.com/
----

To find the status of a specific user’s migration, use the
_SourceUserPrincipalName_ parameter:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL <PartnerCrossTenantHostURL> -SourceUserPrincipalName <UPN>
----

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOUserAndContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL https://m365x946316-my.sharepoint.com -SourceUserPrincipalName DiegoS@M365x016651.OnMicrosoft.com
----

To get the status of the move based on a particular user’s UPN but with
more information, use the _-Verbose_ parameter.

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMoveState -PartnerCrossTenantHostURL https://ttesttenant-my.sharepoint.com -SourceUserPrincipalName User3@stesttenant.onmicrosoft.com -Verbose 
----

=== Migration States

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Status |Description
|NotStarted |The migration hasn’t yet started.

|Scheduled |The migration is now in the queue and is scheduled to run
when a slot becomes available.

|ReadytoTrigger |The Migration is in its pre-flight stage and will start
the Migration shortly.

|InProgress |The migration is in progress in one of the following
states: - Validation - Backup - Restore - Cleanup

|Success |The Migration has completed successfully.

|Rescheduled |The migration may not have completed and has been requeued

=== Post-migration status checks

*Target tenant*: After the migration has successfully completed, check
the status of the user on the target tenant by logging into their new
OneDrive account.

*Source tenant*: Since the user has successfully migrated to the target
tenant, they no longer have an active OneDrive account on the source.
