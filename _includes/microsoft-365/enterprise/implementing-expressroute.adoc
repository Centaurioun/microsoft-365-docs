== Implementing ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365

_This article applies to Microsoft 365 Enterprise._

ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 provides an alternate routing path to
many internet facing Microsoft 365 services. The architecture of
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 is based on advertising public IP
prefixes of Microsoft 365 services that are already accessible over the
Internet into your provisioned ExpressRoute circuits for subsequent
redistribution of those IP prefixes into your network. With ExpressRoute
you effectively enable several different routing paths, through the
internet and through ExpressRoute, for many Microsoft 365 services. This
state of routing on your network may represent a significant change to
how your internal network topology is designed.

____
[!NOTE] We *do not recommend* ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 because it
does not provide the best connectivity model for the service in most
circumstances. As such, Microsoft authorization is required to use this
connectivity model. We review every customer request and authorize
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 only in the rare scenarios where it is
necessary. Please read the https://aka.ms/erguide[ExpressRoute for
Microsoft 365 guide] for more information and following a comprehensive
review of the document with your productivity, network, and security
teams, work with your Microsoft account team to submit an exception if
needed. Unauthorized subscriptions trying to create route filters for
Microsoft 365 will receive an
https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3181709[error message].
____

You have to carefully plan your ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365
implementation to accommodate for the network complexities of having
routing available via both a dedicated circuit with routes injected into
your core network and the internet. If you and your team don’t perform
the detailed planning and testing in this guide, there is a high risk
you’ll experience intermittent or a total loss of connectivity to
Microsoft 365 services when the ExpressRoute circuit is enabled.

To have a successful implementation, you will need to analyze your
infrastructure requirements, go through detailed network assessment and
design, carefully plan the rollout in a staged and controlled manner,
and build a detailed validation and testing plan. For a large,
distributed environment it’s not uncommon to see implementations span
several months. This guide is designed to help you plan ahead.

Large successful deployments may take six months in planning and often
include team members from many areas in the organization including
networking, Firewall and Proxy server administrators, Microsoft 365
administrators, security, end-user support, project management, and
executive sponsorship. Your investment in the planning process will
reduce the likelihood that you’ll experience deployment failures
resulting in downtime or complex and expensive troubleshooting.

We expect the following pre-requisites to be completed before this
implementation guide is started.

[arabic]
. You’ve completed a network assessment to determine if ExpressRoute is
recommended and approved.
. You’ve selected an ExpressRoute network service provider. Find details
about the link:/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations[ExpressRoute
partners and peering locations].
. You’ve already read and understand the
link:/azure/expressroute/[ExpressRoute documentation] and your internal
network is able to meet ExpressRoute pre-requisites end to end.
. Your team has read all of the public guidance and documentation at
link:./azure-expressroute.md[https://aka.ms/expressrouteoffice365],
https://aka.ms/ert, and watched the
https://channel9.msdn.com/series/aer[Azure ExpressRoute for Microsoft
365 Training] series on Channel 9 to gain an understanding of critical
technical details including:
* The internet dependencies of SaaS services.
* How to avoid asymmetric routes and handle complex routing.
* How to incorporate perimeter security, availability, and application
level controls.

=== Begin by gathering requirements

Start by determining which features and services you plan to adopt
within your organization. You need to determine which features of the
different Microsoft 365 services will be used and which locations on
your network will host people using those features. With the catalog of
scenarios, you need to add the network attributes that each of those
scenarios require; such as inbound and outbound network traffic flows
and if the Microsoft 365 endpoints are available over ExpressRoute or
not.

To gather your organization’s requirements:

* Catalog the inbound and outbound network traffic for the Microsoft 365
services your organization is using. Consult Microsoft 365 URLs and IP
address ranges page for the description of flows that different
Microsoft 365 scenarios require.
* Gather documentation of existing network topology showing details of
your internal WAN backbone and topology, connectivity of satellite
sites, last mile user connectivity, routing to network perimeter egress
points, and proxy services.
** Identify inbound service endpoints on the network diagrams that
Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services will connect to, showing both
internet and proposed ExpressRoute connection paths.
** Identify all geographic user locations and WAN connectivity between
locations along with which locations currently have an egress to the
internet and which locations are proposed to have an egress to an
ExpressRoute peering location.
** Identify all edge devices, such as proxies, firewalls, and so on, and
catalog their relationship to flows going over the Internet and
ExpressRoute.
** Document whether end users will access Microsoft 365 services via
Direct Routing or indirect application proxy for both Internet and
ExpressRoute flows.
* Add the location of your tenant and meet-me locations to your network
diagram.
* Estimate the expected and observed network performance and latency
characteristics from major user locations to Microsoft 365. Keep in mind
that Microsoft 365 is a global and distributed set of services and users
will be connecting to locations that may be different from the location
of their tenant. For this reason, it is recommended to measure and
optimize for latency between the user and the closest edge of Microsoft
global network over ExpressRoute and Internet connections. You can use
your findings from the network assessment to aid with this task.
* List company network security and high availability requirements that
need to be met with the new ExpressRoute connection. For example, how do
users continue to get access to Microsoft 365 in the event of the
Internet egress or ExpressRoute circuit failure.
* Document which inbound and outbound Microsoft 365 network flows will
use the Internet path and which will use ExpressRoute. The specifics of
geographical locations of your users and details of your on-premises
network topology may require the plan to be different from one user
location to another.

==== Catalog your outbound and inbound network traffic

To minimize routing and other network complexities, we recommend that
you only use ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 for the network traffic
flows that are required to go over a dedicated connection due to
regulatory requirements or as the result of the network assessment.
Additionally, we recommend that you stage the scope of ExpressRoute
routing and approach outbound and inbound network traffic flows as
different and distinct stages of the implementation project. Deploy
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 for just user initiated outbound network
traffic flows and leave inbound network traffic flows across the
Internet can help to control the increase in topological complexity and
risks of introducing additional asymmetric routing possibilities.

Your network traffic catalog should contain listings of all the inbound
and outbound network connections that you’ll have between your
on-premises network and Microsoft.

* Outbound network traffic flows are any scenarios where a connection is
initiated from your on-premises environment, such as from internal
clients or servers, with a destination of the Microsoft services. These
connections may be direct to Microsoft 365 or indirect, such as when the
connection goes through proxy servers, firewalls, or other networking
devices on the path to Microsoft 365.
* Inbound network traffic flows are any scenarios where a connection is
initiated from the Microsoft cloud to an on-premises host. These
connections typically need to go through firewall and other security
infrastructure that customer security policy requires for externally
originated flows.

Read the link:#ensuring-route-symmetry[Ensuring route symmetry] section
to determine which services will send inbound traffic and look for the
column marked *ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365* in the
https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2[Microsoft
365 endpoints] reference article to determine the rest of the
connectivity information.

For each service that requires an outbound connection, you’ll want to
describe the planned connectivity for the service including network
routing, proxy configuration, packet inspection, and bandwidth needs.

For each service that requires an inbound connection, you’ll need some
additional information. Servers in the Microsoft cloud will establish
connections to your on-premises network. To ensure the connections are
made correctly, you’ll want to describe all aspects of this
connectivity, including; the public DNS entries for the services that
will accept these inbound connections, the CIDR formatted IPv4 IP
addresses, which ISP equipment is involved, and how inbound NAT or
source NAT is handled for these connections.

Inbound connections should be reviewed regardless of whether they’re
connecting over the internet or ExpressRoute to ensure asymmetric
routing hasn’t been introduced. In some cases, on-premises endpoints
that Microsoft 365 services initiate inbound connections to may also
need to be accessed by other Microsoft and non-Microsoft services. It is
paramount that enabling ExpressRoute routing to these services for
Microsoft 365 purposes doesn’t break other scenarios. In many cases,
customers may need to implement specific changes to their internal
network, such as source-based NAT, to ensure that inbound flows from
Microsoft remain symmetric after ExpressRoute is enabled.

Here’s a sample of the level of detail required. In this case Exchange
Hybrid would route to the on-premises system over ExpressRoute.

==== Your network topology design with regional connectivity

Once you understand the services and their associated network traffic
flows, you can create a network diagram that incorporates these new
connectivity requirements and illustrates the changes you’ll make to use
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365. Your diagram should include:

[arabic]
. All user locations where Microsoft 365 and other services will be
accessed from.
. All internet and ExpressRoute egress points.
. All outbound and inbound devices that manage connectivity in and out
of the network, including routers, firewalls, application proxy servers,
and intrusion detection/prevention.
. Internal destinations for all inbound traffic, such as internal ADFS
servers that accept connections from the ADFS web application proxy
servers.
. Catalog of all IP subnets that will be advertised
. Identify each location where people will access Microsoft 365 from and
list the meet-me locations that will be used for ExpressRoute.
. Locations and portions of your internal network topology, where
Microsoft IP prefixes learned from ExpressRoute will be accepted,
filtered, and propagated to.
. The network topology should illustrate the geographic location of each
network segment and how it connects to the Microsoft network over
ExpressRoute and/or the Internet.

The diagram below shows each location where people will be using
Microsoft 365 from along with the inbound and outbound routing
advertisements to Microsoft 365.

image::../media/d866b36b-49bf-416b-af1b-d054e24989d2.png[ExpressRoute
regional geographic meet-me.]

For outbound traffic, the people access Microsoft 365 in one of three
ways:

[arabic]
. Through a meet-me location in North America for the people in
California.
. Through a meet-me location in Hong Kong for the people in Hong Kong.
. Through the internet in Bangladesh where there are fewer people and no
ExpressRoute circuit provisioned.

image::../media/8319943d-08f0-4781-9ef3-d23de2ad4671.png[Outbound
connections for regional diagram.]

Similarly, the inbound network traffic from Microsoft 365 returns in one
of three ways:

[arabic]
. Through a meet-me location in North America for the people in
California.
. Through a meet-me location in Hong Kong for the people in Hong Kong.
. Through the internet in Bangladesh where there are fewer people and no
ExpressRoute circuit provisioned.

image::../media/d6d6160d-bf28-4de3-a787-186c7432b306.png[Inbound
connections for regional diagram.]

==== Determine the appropriate meet-me location

The selection of meet-me locations, which are the physical location
where your ExpressRoute circuit connects your network to the Microsoft
network, is influenced by the locations where people will access
Microsoft 365 from. As a SaaS offering, Microsoft 365 does not operate
under the IaaS or PaaS regional model in the same way Azure does.
Instead, Microsoft 365 is a distributed set of collaboration services,
where users may need to connect to endpoints across multiple datacenters
and regions, which may not necessarily be in the same location or region
where the user’s tenant is hosted.

This means the most important consideration you need to make when
selecting meet-me locations for ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 is where
the people in your organization will be connecting from. The general
recommendation for optimal Microsoft 365 connectivity is implement
routing, so that user requests to Microsoft 365 services are handed off
into the Microsoft network over the shortest network path, this is also
often being referred to as `hot potato' routing. For example, if most of
the Microsoft 365 users are in one or two locations, selecting meet-me
locations that are in the closest proximity to the location of those
users will create the optimal design. If your company has large user
populations in many different regions, you may want to consider having
multiple ExpressRoute circuits and meet-me locations. For some of your
user locations, the shortest/most optimal path into Microsoft network
and Microsoft 365, may not be through your internal WAN and ExpressRoute
meet-me points, but via the Internet.

Often, there are multiple meet-me locations that could be selected
within a region with relative proximity to your users. Fill out the
following table to guide your decisions.

===== Planned ExpressRoute meet-me locations in California and New York

[width="100%",cols="25%,26%,23%,26%",options="header",]
|===
|Location |Number of people |Expected latency to Microsoft network over
Internet egress |Expected latency to Microsoft network over ExpressRoute
|Los Angeles |10,000 |~15ms |~10ms (via Silicon Valley)

|Washington DC |15,000 |~20ms |~10ms (via New York)

|Dallas |5,000 |~15ms |~40ms (via New York)
|===

Once the global network architecture showing the Microsoft 365 region,
ExpressRoute network service provider meet-me locations, and the
quantity of people by location has been developed, it can be used to
identify if any optimizations can be made. It may also show global
hairpin network connections where traffic routes to a distant location
in order to get the meet-me location. If a hairpin on the global network
is discovered, it should be remediated before continuing. Either find
another meet-me location, or use selective Internet breakout egress
points to avoid the hairpin.

The first diagram, shows an example of a customer with two physical
locations in North America. You can see the information about office
locations, Microsoft 365 tenant locations, and several choices for
ExpressRoute meet-me locations. In this example, the customer has
selected the meet-me location based on two principles, in order:

[arabic]
. Closest proximity to the people in their organization.
. Closest in proximity to a Microsoft datacenter where Microsoft 365 is
hosted.

image::../media/5ec38274-b317-4ec1-91c8-90c2a7fd32ca.png[ExpressRoute US
geographic meet-me.]

Expanding this concept slightly further, the second diagram shows an
example multi-national customer faced with similar information and
decision making. This customer has a small office in Bangladesh with
only a small team of ten people focused on growing their footprint in
the region. There is a meet-me location in Chennai and a Microsoft
datacenter with Microsoft 365 hosted in Chennai so a meet-me location
would make sense; however, for ten people, the expense of the extra
circuit is burdensome. As you look at your network, you’ll need to
determine if the latency involved in sending your network traffic across
your network is more effective than spending the capital to acquire
another ExpressRoute circuit.

Alternatively, the ten people in Bangladesh may experience better
performance with their network traffic sent over the internet to the
Microsoft network than they would routing on their internal network as
we showed in the introductory diagrams and reproduced below.

connections for regional diagram.]

=== Create your ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 implementation plan

Your implementation plan should encompass both the technical details of
configuring ExpressRoute and the details of configuring all the other
infrastructure on your network, such as the following.

* Plan which services split between ExpressRoute and Internet.
* Plan for bandwidth, security, high availability, and failover.
* Design inbound and outbound routing, including proper routing path
optimizations for different locations
* Decide how far ExpressRoute routes will be advertised into your
network and what is the mechanism for clients to select Internet or
ExpressRoute path; for example, direct routing or application proxy.
* Plan DNS record changes, including
link:../security/office-365-security/email-authentication-spf-configure.md[Sender
Policy Framework] entries.
* Plan NAT strategy including outbound and inbound source NAT.

==== Plan your routing with both internet and ExpressRoute network paths

* For your initial deployment, all inbound services, such as inbound
email or hybrid connectivity, are recommended to use the internet.
* Plan end-user client LAN routing, such as
link:./managing-office-365-endpoints.md[configuring a PAC/WPAD file],
default route, proxy servers, and BGP route advertisements.
* Plan perimeter routing, including proxy servers, firewalls, and cloud
proxies.

==== Plan your bandwidth, security, high availability, and failover

Create a plan for bandwidth required for each major Microsoft 365
workload. Separately estimate Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and
Skype for Business Online bandwidth requirements. You can use the
estimation calculators we’ve provided for Exchange Online and Skype for
Business as a starting place; however, a pilot test with a
representative sample of the user profiles and locations is required to
fully understand the bandwidth needs of your organization.

Add how security is handled at each internet and ExpressRoute egress
location to your plan, remember all ExpressRoute connections to
Microsoft 365 use public peering and must still be secured in accordance
with your company security policies of connecting to external networks.

Add details to your plan about which people will be affected by what
type of outage and how those people will be able to perform their work
at full capacity in the simplest manner.

===== Plan bandwidth requirements including Skype for Business requirements on Jitter, Latency, Congestion, and Headroom

Skype for Business Online also has specific extra network requirements,
which are detailed in the article
https://support.office.com/article/Media-Quality-and-Network-Connectivity-Performance-in-Skype-for-Business-Online-5fe3e01b-34cf-44e0-b897-b0b2a83f0917[Media

365 performance tuning using baselines and performance history].

===== Plan for high availability requirements

Create a plan for high availability to meet your needs and incorporate
this into your updated network topology diagram. Read the section

availability and failover with Azure ExpressRoute].

this into your updated network topology diagram. Read the section
link:#applying-security-controls-to-azure-expressroute-for-microsoft-365-scenarios[Applying
security controls to Azure ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 scenarios].

==== Design outbound service connectivity

ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 has _outbound_ network requirements that
may be unfamiliar. Specifically, the IP addresses that represent your
users and networks to Microsoft 365 and act as the source endpoints for
outbound network connections to Microsoft must follow specific
requirements outlined below.

[arabic]
. The endpoints must be public IP addresses, that are registered to your
company or to carrier providing ExpressRoute connectivity to you.
. The endpoints must be advertised to Microsoft and validated/accepted
by ExpressRoute.
. The endpoints must not be advertised to the Internet with the same or
more preferred routing metric.
. The endpoints must not be used for connectivity to Microsoft services
that are not configured over ExpressRoute.

If your network design doesn’t meet these requirements, there is a high
risk your users will experience connectivity failures to Microsoft 365
and other Microsoft services due to route black holing or asymmetric
routing. This occurs when requests to Microsoft services are routed over
ExpressRoute, but responses are routed back across the internet, or vice
versa, and the responses are dropped by stateful network devices such as
firewalls.

The most common method you can use to meet the above requirements is to
use source NAT, either implemented as a part of your network or provided
by your ExpressRoute carrier. Source NAT allows you to abstract the
details and private IP addressing of your internet network from
ExpressRoute and; coupled with proper IP route advertisements, provide
an easy mechanism to ensure path symmetry. If you’re using stateful
network devices that are specific to ExpressRoute peering locations, you
must implement separate NAT pools for each ExpressRoute peering to
ensure path symmetry.

Read more about the
link:/azure/expressroute/expressroute-nat[ExpressRoute NAT
requirements].

Add the changes for the outbound connectivity to the network topology
diagram.

==== Design inbound service connectivity

Most enterprise Microsoft 365 deployments assume some form of inbound
connectivity from Microsoft 365 to on-premises services, such as for
Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business hybrid scenarios, mailbox
migrations, and authentication using ADFS infrastructure. When
ExpressRoute you enable an extra routing path between your on-premises
network and Microsoft for outbound connectivity, these inbound
connections may inadvertently be impacted by asymmetric routing, even if
you intend to have those flows continue to use the Internet. A few
precautions described below are recommended to ensure there is no impact
to Internet based inbound flows from Microsoft 365 to on-premises
systems.

To minimize the risks of asymmetric routing for inbound network traffic
flows, all of the inbound connections should use source NAT before
they’re routed into segments of your network, which have routing
visibility into ExpressRoute. If the incoming connections are allowed
onto a network segment with routing visibility into ExpressRoute without
source NAT, requests originating from Microsoft 365 will enter from the
internet, but the response going back to Microsoft 365 will prefer the
ExpressRoute network path back to the Microsoft network, causing
asymmetric routing.

You may consider one of the following implementation patterns to satisfy
this requirement:

[arabic]
. Perform source NAT before requests are routed into your internal
network using networking equipment such as firewalls or load balancers
on the path from the Internet to your on-premises systems.
. Ensure that ExpressRoute routes are not propagated to the network
segments where inbound services, such as front-end servers or reverse
proxy systems, handling Internet connections reside.

Explicitly accounting for these scenarios in your network and keeping
all inbound network traffic flows over the Internet helps to minimize
deployment and operational risk of asymmetric routing.

There may be cases where you may choose to direct some inbound flows
over ExpressRoute connections. For these scenarios, take the following
extra considerations into account.

[arabic]
. Microsoft 365 can only target on-premises endpoints that use public
IPs. This means that even if the on-premises inbound endpoint is only
exposed to Microsoft 365 over ExpressRoute, it still needs to have
public IP associated with it.
. All DNS name resolution that Microsoft 365 services perform to resolve
on-premises endpoints happen using public DNS. This means that you must
register inbound service endpoints’ FQDN to IP mappings on the Internet.
. In order to receive inbound network connections over ExpressRoute, the
public IP subnets for these endpoints must be advertised to Microsoft
over ExpressRoute.
. Carefully evaluate these inbound network traffic flows to ensure that
proper security and network controls are applied to them in accordance
with your company security and network policies.
. Once your on-premises inbound endpoints are advertised to Microsoft
over ExpressRoute, ExpressRoute will effectively become the preferred
routing path to those endpoints for all Microsoft services, including
Microsoft 365. This means that those endpoint subnets must only be used
for communications with Microsoft 365 services and no other services on
the Microsoft network. Otherwise, your design will cause asymmetric
routing where inbound connections from other Microsoft services prefer
to route inbound over ExpressRoute, while the return path will use the
Internet.
. In the event an ExpressRoute circuit or meet-me location is down,
you’ll need to ensure the on-premises inbound endpoints are still
available to accept requests over a separate network path. This may mean
advertising subnets for those endpoints through multiple ExpressRoute
circuits.
. We recommend applying source NAT for all inbound network traffic flows
entering your network through ExpressRoute, especially when these flows
cross stateful network devices such as firewalls.
. Some on-premises services, such as ADFS proxy or Exchange
autodiscover, may receive inbound requests from both Microsoft 365
services and users from the Internet. For these requests Microsoft 365
will target the same FQDN as user requests over the Internet. Allowing
inbound user connections from the internet to those on-premises
endpoints, while forcing Microsoft 365 connections to use ExpressRoute,
represents significant routing complexity. For the vast majority of
customers implementing such complex scenarios over ExpressRoute is not
recommended due to operational considerations. This additional overhead
includes, managing risks of asymmetric routing and will require you to
carefully manage routing advertisements and policies across multiple
dimensions.

==== Update your network topology plan to show how you would avoid asymmetric routes

You want to avoid asymmetric routing to ensure people in your
organization can seamlessly use Microsoft 365 as well as other important
services on the internet. There are two common configurations customers
have that cause asymmetric routing. Now’s a good time to review the
network configuration you’re planning to use and check if one of these
asymmetric routing scenarios could exist.

To begin, we’ll examine a few different situations associated with the
following network diagram. In this diagram, all servers that receive
inbound requests, such as ADFS or on-premises hybrid servers are in the
New Jersey data center and are advertised to the internet.

[arabic]
. While the perimeter network is secure, there is no Source NAT
available for incoming requests.
. The servers in the New Jersey data center are able to see both
internet and ExpressRoute routes.

image::../media/8f074af6-ef38-44e8-bc5a-8b4d981fbb20.png[ExpressRoute
connectivity overview.]

We also have suggestions on how to fix them.

===== Problem 1: Cloud to on-premises connection over the Internet

The following diagram illustrates the asymmetric network path taken when
your network configuration doesn’t provide NAT for inbound requests from
the Microsoft cloud over the internet.

[arabic]
. The inbound request from Microsoft 365 retrieves the IP address of the
on-premises endpoint from public DNS and sends the request to your
perimeter network.
. In this faulty configuration, there is no Source NAT configured or
available at the perimeter network where the traffic is sent resulting
in the actual source IP address being used as the return destination.

* The server on your network routes the return traffic to Microsoft 365
through any available ExpressRoute network connection.
* The result is an Asymmetric path for that flow to Microsoft 365,
resulting in a broken connection.

image::../media/9c210c2a-e0ea-4180-8ede-1bf41746ce7a.png[ExpressRoute
Asymetric routing problem 1.]

====== Solution 1a: Source NAT

Simply adding a source NAT to the inbound request resolves this
misconfigured network. In this diagram:

[arabic]
. The incoming request continues to enter through the New Jersey data
center’s perimeter network. This time Source NAT is available.
. The response from the server routes back toward the IP associated with
the Source NAT instead of the original IP address, resulting in the
response returning along the same network path.

image::../media/0e87a155-f8de-48ed-92ac-27367b727a82.png[ExpressRoute
Asymetric routing solution 1.]

====== Solution 1b: Route Scoping

Alternatively, you can choose to not allow the ExpressRoute BGP prefixes
to be advertised, removing the alternate network path for those
computers. In this diagram:

[arabic]
. The incoming request continues to enter through the New Jersey data
center’s perimeter network. This time the prefixes advertised from
Microsoft over the ExpressRoute circuit are not available to the New
Jersey data center.
. The response from the server routes back toward the IP associated with
the original IP address over the only route available, resulting in the
response returning along the same network path.

Asymetric routing solution 2.]

===== Problem 2: Cloud to on-premises connection over ExpressRoute

The following diagram illustrates the asymmetric network path taken when
your network configuration doesn’t provide NAT for inbound requests from
the Microsoft cloud over ExpressRoute.

[arabic]
. The inbound request from Microsoft 365 retrieves the IP address from
DNS and sends the request to your perimeter network.
. In this faulty configuration, there is no Source NAT configured or
available at the perimeter network where the traffic is sent resulting
in the actual source IP address being used as the return destination.

* The computer on your network routes the return traffic to Microsoft
365 through any available ExpressRoute network connection.
* The result is an Asymmetric connection to Microsoft 365.

Asymetric routing problem 2.]

====== Solution 2: Source NAT

Simply adding a source NAT to the inbound request resolves this
misconfigured network. In this diagram:

[arabic]
. The incoming request continues to enter through the New York data
center’s perimeter network. This time Source NAT is available.
. The response from the server routes back toward the IP associated with
the Source NAT instead of the original IP address, resulting in the
response returning along the same network path.

Asymetric routing solution 3.]

==== Paper verify that the network design has path symmetry

At this point, you need to verify on paper that your implementation plan
offers route symmetry for the different scenarios in which you’ll be
using Microsoft 365. You’ll identify the specific network route that is
expected to be taken when a person uses different features of the
service. From the on-premises network and WAN routing, to the perimeter
devices, to the connectivity path; ExpressRoute or the internet, and on
to the connection to the online endpoint.

You’ll need to do this for all of the Microsoft 365 network services
that were previously identified as services that your organization will
adopt.

It helps to do this paper walk-through of routes with a second person.
Explain to them where each network hop is expected to get its next route
from and ensure that you’re familiar with the routing paths. Remember
that ExpressRoute will always provide a more scoped route to Microsoft
server IP addresses giving it lower route cost than an Internet default
route.

==== Design Client Connectivity Configuration

image::../media/7cfa6482-dbae-416a-ae6f-a45e5f4de23b.png[Using PAC files
with ExpressRoute.]

If you’re using a proxy server for internet bound traffic, then you need
to adjust any PAC or client configuration files to ensure client
computers on your network are correctly configured to send the
ExpressRoute traffic you desire to Microsoft 365 without transiting your
proxy server, and the remaining traffic, including some Microsoft 365
traffic, is sent to the relevant proxy. Read our guide on
link:./managing-office-365-endpoints.md[managing Microsoft 365
endpoints], for example, PAC files.

____
[!NOTE] The endpoints change frequently, as often as weekly. You should
only make changes based on the services and features your organization
has adopted to reduce the number of changes you’ll need to make to stay
current. Pay close attention to the *Effective Date* in the RSS feed
where the changes are announced and a record is kept of all past
changes, IP addresses that are announced may not be advertised, or
removed from advertisement, until the effective date is reached.
____

=== Ensuring route symmetry

The Microsoft 365 front-end servers are accessible on both the Internet
and ExpressRoute. These servers will prefer to route back to on-premises
over ExpressRoute circuits when both are available. Because of this,
there is a possibility of route asymmetry if traffic from your network
prefers to route over your Internet circuits. Asymmetrical routes are a
problem because devices that perform stateful packet inspection can
block return traffic that follows a different path than the outbound
packets followed.

Regardless of whether you initiate a connection to Microsoft 365 over
the Internet or ExpressRoute, the source must be a publicly routable
address. With many customers peering directly with Microsoft, having
private addresses where duplication is possible between customers isn’t
feasible.

The following are scenarios where communications from Microsoft 365 to
your on-premises network will be initiated. To simplify your network
design, we recommend routing the following over the Internet path.

* SMTP services such as mail from an Exchange Online tenant to an
on-premises host or SharePoint Online Mail sent from SharePoint Online
to an on-premises host. SMTP protocol is used more broadly within
Microsoft’s network than the route prefixes shared over ExpressRoute
circuits and advertising on-premises SMTP servers over ExpressRoute will
cause failures with these other services.
* ADFS during password validation for signing in.
* link:/exchange/exchange-hybrid[Exchange Server Hybrid deployments].
* link:/SharePoint/hybrid/display-hybrid-federated-search-results-in-sharepoint-online[SharePoint

for Business Cloud Connector].

For Microsoft to route back to your network for these bi-directional
traffic flows, the BGP routes to your on-premises devices must be shared
with Microsoft. When you advertise route prefixes to Microsoft over
ExpressRoute, you should follow these best practices:

[arabic]
. Do not advertise the same public IP Address route prefix to the public
Internet and over ExpressRoute. It is recommended that the IP BGP Route
Prefix advertisements to Microsoft over ExpressRoute are from a range
that is not advertised to the internet at all. If this is not possible
to achieve due to the available IP Address space, then it is essential
to ensure you advertise a more specific range over ExpressRoute than any
internet circuits.
. Use separate NAT IP pools per ExpressRoute circuit and separate to
that of your internet circuits.
. Any route advertised to Microsoft will attract network traffic from
any server in Microsoft’s network, not only those for which routes are
advertised to your network over ExpressRoute. Only advertise routes to
servers where routing scenarios are defined and well understood by your
team. Advertise separate IP Address route prefixes at each of multiple
ExpressRoute circuits from your network.

=== High availability and failover with Azure ExpressRoute

We recommend provisioning at least two active circuits from each egress
with ExpressRoute to your ExpressRoute provider. This is the most common
place we see failures for customers and you can easily avoid it by
provisioning a pair of active/active ExpressRoute circuits. We also
recommend at least two active/active Internet circuits because many
Microsoft 365 services are only available over the Internet.

Inside the egress point of your network are many other devices and
circuits that play a critical role in how people perceive availability.
These portions of your connectivity scenarios are not covered by
ExpressRoute or Microsoft 365 SLAs, but they play a critical role in the
end-to-end service availability as perceived by people in your
organization.

Focus on the people using and operating Microsoft 365, if a failure of
any one component would affect peoples’ experience using the service,
look for ways to limit the total percentage of people affected. If a
failover mode is operationally complex, consider the peoples’ experience
of a long time to recovery and look for operationally simple and
automated failover modes.

Outside of your network, Microsoft 365, ExpressRoute, and your
ExpressRoute provider all have different levels of availability.

==== Service Availability

* Microsoft 365 services are covered by well-defined
link:/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/service-level-agreement[service
level agreements], which include uptime and availability metrics for
individual services. One reason Microsoft 365 can maintain such high
service availability levels is the ability for individual components to
seamlessly fail over between the many Microsoft datacenters, using the
global Microsoft network. This failover extends from the datacenter and
network to the multiple Internet egress points, and enables failover
seamlessly from the perspective of the people using the service.
* ExpressRoute
https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/expressroute/v1_0/[provides
a 99.9% availability SLA] on individual dedicated circuits between the
Microsoft Network Edge and the ExpressRoute provider or partner
infrastructure. These service levels are applied at the ExpressRoute
circuit level, which consists of
link:/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction[two independent
interconnects] between the redundant Microsoft equipment and the network
provider equipment in each peering location.

==== Provider Availability

* Microsoft’s service level arrangements stop at your ExpressRoute
provider or partner. This is also the first place you can make choices
that will influence your availability level. You should closely evaluate
the architecture, availability, and resiliency characteristics your
ExpressRoute provider offers between your network perimeter and your
providers connection at each Microsoft peering location. Pay close
attention to both the logical and physical aspects of redundancy,
peering equipment, carrier provided WAN circuits, and any extra value
add services such as NAT services or managed firewalls.

==== Designing your availability plan

We strongly recommend that you plan and design high availability and
resiliency into your end-to-end connectivity scenarios for Microsoft
365. A design should include;

* No single points of failure, including both Internet and ExpressRoute
circuits.
* Minimizing the number of people affected and duration of that impact
for most anticipated failure modes.
* Optimizing for simple, repeatable, and automatic recovery process from
most anticipated failure modes.
* Supporting the full demands of your network traffic and functionality
through redundant paths, without substantial degradation.

Your connectivity scenarios should include a network topology that is
optimized for multiple independent and active network paths to Microsoft
365. This will yield a better end-to-end availability than a topology
that is optimized only for redundancy at the individual device or
equipment level.

____
[!TIP] If your users are distributed across multiple continents or
geographic regions and each of those locations connects over redundant
WAN circuits to a single on-premises location where a single
ExpressRoute circuit is located, your users will experience less
end-to-end service availability than a network topology design that
includes independent ExpressRoute circuits that connect the different
regions to the nearest peering location.
____

We recommend provisioning at least two ExpressRoute circuits with each
circuit connecting to with a different geographic peering location. You
should provision this active-active pair of circuits for every region
where people will use ExpressRoute connectivity for Microsoft 365
services. This allows each region to remain connected during a disaster
that affects a major location such as a datacenter or peering location.
Configuring them in as active/active allows end user traffic to be
distributed across multiple network paths. This reduces the scope of
people affected during device or network equipment outages.

We don’t recommend using a single ExpressRoute circuit with the Internet
as a backup.

==== Example: Failover and High Availability

Contoso’s multi-geographic design has undergone a review of routing,
bandwidth, security, and now must go through a high availability review.
Contoso thinks about high availability as covering three categories;
resiliency, reliability, and redundancy.

Resiliency allows Contoso to recover from failures quickly. Reliability
allows Contoso to offer a consistent outcome within the system.
Redundancy allows Contoso to a move between one or more mirrored
instances of infrastructure.

Within each edge configuration, Contoso has redundant Firewalls,
Proxies, and IDS. For North America, Contoso has one edge configuration
in their Dallas datacenter and another edge configuration in their
Virginia datacenter. The redundant equipment at each location offers
resiliency to that location.

The network configuration at Contoso is built based on a few key
principles:

* Within each geographic region, there are multiple Azure ExpressRoute
circuits.
* Each circuit within a region can support all of the network traffic
within that region.
* Routing will clearly prefer one or the other path depending on
availability, location, and so on.
* Failover between Azure ExpressRoute circuits happens automatically
without additional configuration or action required by Contoso.
* Failover between Internet circuits happens automatically without
additional configuration or action required by Contoso.

In this configuration, with redundancy at the physical and virtual
level, Contoso is able to offer local resiliency, regional resiliency,
and global resiliency in a reliable way. Contoso elected this
configuration after evaluating a single Azure ExpressRoute circuit per
region as well as the possibility of failing over to the internet.

If Contoso was unable to have multiple Azure ExpressRoute circuits per
region, routing traffic originating in North America to the Azure
ExpressRoute circuit in Asia Pacific would add an unacceptable level of
latency and the required DNS forwarder configuration adds complexity.

Using the internet as a backup configuration isn’t recommended. This
breaks Contoso’s reliability principle, resulting in an inconsistent
experience using the connection. Additionally, manual configuration
would be required to fail over considering the BGP advertisements that
have been configured, NAT configuration, DNS configuration, and the
proxy configuration. This added failover complexity increases the time
to recover and decreases their ability to diagnose and troubleshoot the
steps involved.

Still have questions about how to plan for and implement traffic
management or Azure ExpressRoute? Read the rest of our
link:./network-planning-and-performance.md[network and performance
guidance] or the link:/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs[Azure
ExpressRoute FAQ].

=== Applying security controls to Azure ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 scenarios

Securing Azure ExpressRoute connectivity starts with the same principles
as securing Internet connectivity. Many customers choose to deploy
network and perimeter controls along the ExpressRoute path connecting
their on-premises network to Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft clouds.
These controls may include firewalls, application proxies, data leakage
prevention, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention systems, and so
on. In many cases customers apply different levels of controls to
traffic initiated from on-premises going to Microsoft, versus traffic
initiated from Microsoft going to customer on-premises network, versus
traffic initiated from on-premises going to a general Internet
destination.

Here’s a few examples of integrating security with the
link:/azure/expressroute/expressroute-connectivity-models[ExpressRoute
connectivity model] you choose to deploy.

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",options="header",]
|===
|*ExpressRoute integration option* |*Network security perimeter model*
|Colocated at a cloud exchange |Install new or use existing
security/perimeter infrastructure in the colocation facility where the
ExpressRoute connection is established. Use colocation facility purely
for routing/interconnect purposes and back haul connections from
colocation facility into the on-premises security/perimeter
infrastructure.

|Point-to-Point Ethernet |Terminate the Point-to-Point ExpressRoute
connection in the existing on-premises security/perimeter infrastructure
location. Install new security/perimeter infrastructure specific to the
ExpressRoute path and terminate the Point-to-Point connection there.

|Any-to-Any IPVPN |Use an existing on-premises security/perimeter
infrastructure at all locations that egress into the IPVPN used for
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 connectivity. Hairpin the IPVPN used for
ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 to specific on-premises locations
designated to serve as the security/perimeter.
|===

Some service providers also offer managed security/perimeter
functionality as a part of their integration solutions with Azure
ExpressRoute.

When considering the topology placement of the network/security
perimeter options used for ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 connections,
following are extra considerations

* The depth and type network/security controls may have impact on the
performance and scalability of the Microsoft 365 user experience.
* Outbound (on-premises->Microsoft) and inbound (Microsoft->on-premises)
[if enabled] flows may have different requirements. These are likely
different than Outbound to general Internet destinations.
* Microsoft 365 requirements for ports/protocols and necessary IP
subnets are the same, whether traffic is routed through ExpressRoute for
Microsoft 365 or through the Internet.
* Topological placement of the customer network/security controls
determines the ultimate end to end network between the user and
Microsoft 365 service and can have a substantial impact on network
latency and congestion.
* Customers are encouraged to design their security/perimeter topology
for use with ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 in accordance with best
practices for redundancy, high availability, and disaster recovery.

Here’s an example of Contoso that compares the different Azure
ExpressRoute connectivity options with the perimeter security models
discussed above.

==== Example: Securing Azure ExpressRoute

Contoso is considering implementing Azure ExpressRoute and after
planning the optimal architecture for ExpressRoute for Microsoft 365 and
after using the above guidance to understand bandwidth requirements,
they’re determining the best method for securing their perimeter.

For Contoso, a multi-national organization with locations in multiple
continents, security must span all perimeters. The optimal connectivity
option for Contoso is a multi-point connection with multiple peering
locations around the globe to service the needs of their employees in
each continent. Each continent includes redundant Azure ExpressRoute
circuits within the continent and security must span all of these.

Contoso’s existing infrastructure is reliable and can handle the extra
work, as a result, Contoso is able to use the infrastructure for their
Azure ExpressRoute and internet perimeter security. If this weren’t the
case, Contoso could choose to purchase more equipment to supplement
their existing equipment or to handle a different type of connection.

=== Bandwidth planning for Azure ExpressRoute

Every Microsoft 365 customer has unique bandwidth needs depending on the
number of people at each location, how active they are with each
Microsoft 365 application, and other factors such as the use of
on-premises or hybrid equipment and network security configurations.

Having too little bandwidth will result in congestion, retransmissions
of data, and unpredictable delays. Having too much bandwidth will result
in unnecessary cost. On an existing network, bandwidth is often referred
to in terms of the amount of available headroom on the circuit as a
percentage. Having 10% headroom will likely result in congestion and
having 80% headroom generally means unnecessary cost. Typical headroom
target allocations are 20% to 50%.

To find the right level of bandwidth, the best mechanism is to test your
existing network consumption. This is the only way to get a true measure
of usage and need as every network configuration and applications are in
some ways unique. When measuring, you’ll want to pay close attention to
the total bandwidth consumption, latency, and TCP congestion to
understand your network needs.

Once you have an estimated baseline that includes all network
applications, pilot Microsoft 365 with a small group that comprises the
different profiles of people in your organization to determine actual
usage, and use the two measurements to estimate the amount of bandwidth
you’ll require for each office location. If there are any latency or TCP
congestion issues found in your testing, you may need to move the egress
closer to the people using Microsoft 365 or remove intensive network
scanning such as SSL decryption/inspection.

All of our recommendations on what type of network processing is
recommended applies to both ExpressRoute and Internet circuits. The same
is true for the rest of the guidance on our
link:./network-planning-and-performance.md[performance tuning site].

=== Build your deployment and testing procedures

Your implementation plan should include both testing and rollback
planning. If your implementation isn’t functioning as expected, the plan
should be designed to affect the least number of people before problems
are discovered. The following are some high-level principles your plan
should consider.

[arabic]
. Stage the network segment and user service onboarding to minimize
disruption.
. Plan for testing routes with traceroute and TCP connect from a
separate internet connected host.
. Preferably, testing of inbound and outbound services should be done on
an isolated test network with a test Microsoft 365 tenant.
* Alternatively, testing can be performed on a production network if the
customer is not yet using Microsoft 365 or is in pilot.
* Alternatively, testing can be performed during a production outage
that is set aside for test and monitoring only.
* Alternatively, testing can be done by checking routes for each service
on each layer 3 router node. This fall back should only be used if no
other testing is possible since a lack of physical testing introduces
risk.

==== Build your deployment procedures

Your deployment procedures should roll out to small groups of people in
stages to allow for testing before deploying to larger groups of people.
The following are several ways to stage the deployment of ExpressRoute.

[arabic]
. Set up ExpressRoute with Microsoft peering and have the route
advertisements forwarded to a single host only for staged testing
purposes.
. Advertise routes to the ExpressRoute network to a single network
segment at first and expand route advertisements by network segment or
region.
. If deploying Microsoft 365 for the first time, use the ExpressRoute
network deployment as a pilot for a few people.
. If using proxy servers, you can alternatively configure a test PAC
file to direct a few people to ExpressRoute with testing and feedback
before adding more.

Your implementation plan should list each of the deployment procedures
that must be taken or commands that need to be used to deploy the
networking configuration. When the network outage time arrives, all of
the changes being made should be from the written deployment plan that
was written in advance and peer reviewed. See our guidance on the
technical configuration of ExpressRoute.

* Updating your SPF TXT records if you’ve changed IP addresses for any
on-premises servers that will continue to send email.
* Updating any DNS entries for on-premises servers if you’ve changed IP
addresses to accommodate a new NAT configuration.
* Ensure you’ve subscribed to the RSS feed for Microsoft 365 endpoint
notifications to maintain any routing or proxy configurations.

After your ExpressRoute deployment is complete, the procedures in the
test plan should be executed. Results for each procedure should be
logged. You must include procedures for rolling back to the original
production environment in the event the test plan results indicate the
implementation was not successful.

==== Build your test procedures

Your testing procedures should include tests for each outbound and
inbound network service for Microsoft 365 both that will be using
ExpressRoute and ones that will not. The procedures should include
testing from each unique network location including users who are not
on-premises in the corporate LAN.

Some examples of test activities include the following.

[arabic]
. Ping from your on-premises router to your network operator router.
. Validate the 500+ Microsoft 365 and CRM Online IP address
advertisements are received by your on-premises router.
. Validate your inbound and outbound NAT is operating between
ExpressRoute and the internal network.
. Validate that routes to your NAT are being advertised from your
router.
. Validate that ExpressRoute has accepted your advertised prefixes.
* Use the following cmdlet to verify peering advertisements:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitRouteTable -DevicePath Primary -ExpressRouteCircuitName TestER -ResourceGroupName RG -PeeringType MicrosoftPeering
----
. Validate your public NAT IP range is not advertised to Microsoft
through any other ExpressRoute or public Internet network circuit unless
it is a specific subset of a larger range as in the previous example.
. ExpressRoute circuits are paired, validate that both BGP sessions are
running.
. Set up a single host on the inside of your NAT and use ping, tracert,
and tcpping to test connectivity across the new circuit to the host
outlook.office365.com. Alternatively, you could use a tool such as
Wireshark or Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 on a mirrored port to the
MSEE to validate you’re able to connect to the IP address associated
with outlook.office365.com.
. Test application level functionality for Exchange Online.

* Test Outlook is able to connect to Exchange Online and send/receive
email.
* Test Outlook is able to use online-mode.
* Test smartphone connectivity and send/receive capability.

[arabic, start=10]
. Test application level functionality for SharePoint Online

* Test OneDrive for Business sync client.
* Test SharePoint Online web access.

[arabic, start=11]
. Test application level functionality for Skype for Business calling
scenarios:

* Join to conference call as authenticated user [invite initiated by end
user].
* Invite user to conference call [invite sent from MCU].
* Join conference as anonymous user using the Skype for Business web
application.
* Join call from your wired PC connection, IP phone, and mobile device.
* Call to federated user o Call to PSTN Validation: call is completed,
call quality is acceptable, connection time is acceptable.
* Verify presence status for contacts is updated for both members of the
tenant and federated users.

==== Common problems

Asymmetric routing is the most common implementation problem. Here are
some common sources to look for:

* Using an open or flat network routing topology without source NAT in
place.
* Not using SNAT to route to inbound services through both the internet
and ExpressRoute connections.
* Not testing inbound services on ExpressRoute on a test network prior
to deploying broadly.

=== Deploying ExpressRoute connectivity through your network

Stage your deployment to one segment of the network at a time,
progressively rolling out the connectivity to different parts of the
network with a plan to roll back for each new network segment. If your
deployment is aligned with an Microsoft 365 deployment, deploy to your
Microsoft 365 pilot users first and extend from there.

First for your test and then for production:

* Run the deployment steps to enable ExpressRoute.
* Test your seeing the network routes are as expected.
* Perform testing on each inbound and outbound service.
* Rollback if you discover any issues.

==== Set up a test connection to ExpressRoute with a test network segment

Now that you have the completed plan on paper it is time to test at a
small scale. In this test you will establish a single ExpressRoute
connection with Microsoft Peering to a test subnet on your on-premises
network. You can configure a
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403802[trial Microsoft 365
tenant] with connectivity to and from the test subnet and include all
outbound and inbound services that you will be using in production in
the test subnet. Set up DNS for the test network segment and establish
all inbound and outbound services. Execute your test plan and ensure
that you are familiar with the routing for each service and the route
propagation.

==== Execute the deployment and test plans

As you complete the items described above, check off the areas you’ve
completed and ensure you and your team have reviewed them before
executing your deployment and testing plans.

* List of outbound and inbound services that are involved in the network
change.
* Global network architecture diagram showing both internet egress and
ExpressRoute meet-me locations.
* Network routing diagram demonstrating the different network paths used
for each service deployed.
* A deployment plan with steps to implement the changes and rollback if
needed.
* A test plan for testing each Microsoft 365 and network service.
* Completed paper validation of production routes for inbound and
outbound services.
* A completed test across a test network segment including availability
testing.

Choose an outage window that is long enough to run through the entire
deployment plan and the test plan, has some time available for
troubleshooting and time for rolling back if necessary.

____
[!CAUTION] Due to the complex nature of routing over both the internet
and ExpressRoute, it is recommended that additional buffer time is added
to this window to handle troubleshooting complex routing.
____

==== Configure QoS for Skype for Business Online

QoS is necessary to obtain voice and meeting benefits for Skype for
Business Online. You can configure QoS after you have ensured that the
ExpressRoute network connection does not block any of your other
Microsoft 365 service access. Configuration for QoS is described in the
article
https://support.office.com/article/ExpressRoute-and-QoS-in-Skype-for-Business-Online-20c654da-30ee-4e4f-a764-8b7d8844431d[ExpressRoute
and QoS in Skype for Business Online] .

=== Troubleshooting your implementation

The first place to look is at the steps in this implementation guide,
were any missed in your implementation plan? Go back and run further
small network testing if possible to replicate the error and debug it
there.

Identify which inbound or outbound services failed during testing. Get
specifically the IP addresses and subnets for each of the services that
failed. Go ahead and walk the network topology diagram on paper and
validate the routing. Validate specifically where the ExpressRoute
routing is advertised to, Test that routing during the outage if
possible with traces.

Run PSPing with a network trace to each customer endpoint and evaluate
source and destination IP addresses to validate that they are as
expected. Run telnet to any mail host that you expose on port 25 and
verify that SNAT is hiding the original source IP address if this is
expected.

Keep in mind that while deploying Microsoft 365 with an ExpressRoute
connection you’ll need to ensure both the network configuration for
ExpressRoute is optimally designed and you’ve also optimized the other
components on your network such as client computers. In addition to
using this planning guide to troubleshoot the steps you may have missed,
we also have written a
