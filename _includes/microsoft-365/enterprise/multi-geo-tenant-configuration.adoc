== Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo _Tenant_ configuration

Before you configure your _Tenant_ for Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, be sure
you have read link:plan-for-multi-geo.md[Plan for Microsoft 365
Multi-Geo].

To follow the steps in this article, you’ll need a list of the
_Geography_ locations that you want to enable as _Satellite Geography_
locations, and the test users that you want to provision for those
locations.

Not all Multi-Geo workloads require customer driven configuration.

=== Configuring Exchange Online for Multi-Geo

There is no customer driven configuration required to prepare Exchange
Online in a Multi-Geo enabled _Tenant_. A customer may use all
Geographies with Exchange Online as soon as Multi-Geo has been enabled
within Exchange Online for their _Tenant_.

=== Configuring Microsoft Teams for Multi-Geo

There is no customer driven configuration required to prepare Microsoft
Teams in a Multi-Geo enabled tenant. A customer may use all Geographies
with Microsoft Teams as soon as Multi-Geo has been enabled within
Microsoft Teams for their _Tenant_.

=== Configuring SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business for Multi-Geo

If you want to store data in a particular Geography, then that Geography
must be configured for SharePoint Online and OneDrive ahead of time.

Once Multi-Geo has been enabled for your _Tenant_ in SharePoint Online
and OneDrive for Business, the *Geo Locations* tab will become available
in the OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online admin centers. If you
do not see the *Geo Locations* tab, then your _Tenant_ has not yet
finished being enabled for Multi-Geo.

To add each Satellite Geography location for SharePoint and OneDrive
where you want to store data:

[arabic]
. Open the SharePoint admin center. and go to *Geo locations*.
. Select *Add location*.
. Select the location that you want to add, and then select *Next*.
. Type the domain that you want to use with the geo location, and then
select *Add*.
. Select *Close*.

Provisioning may take from a few hours up to 72 hours, depending on the
size of your _Tenant_. Once provisioning of a _Satellite Geography_
location has completed, you will receive an email confirmation. When the
new _Geography_ location appears in blue on the map on the Geo locations
tab in the OneDrive and SharePoint admin center, then you can proceed to
set users’ preferred data location to that _Geography_ location.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Your new _Satellite Geography_ location will be set up with
default settings. This will allow you to configure that _Satellite
Geography_ location as appropriate for your local compliance needs.
