== Enabling SharePoint Multi-Geo in your satellite geo location

This article is for Global or SharePoint administrators who have created a Multi-Geo satellite location *before* SharePoint Multi-Geo capabilities became generally available on March 27, 2019, and who have not enabled SharePoint Multi-Geo in their satellite geo location(s).

____
[!Note] If you have added a new geo location *after March 27th, 2019*, you do not need to perform these instructions, as your new geo location will already be enabled for OneDrive and SharePoint Multi-Geo.
____

These instructions will allow you to enable SharePoint in your satellite location, so your Multi-Geo satellite users can take advantage of both OneDrive and SharePoint Multi-Geo capabilities in O365.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Please note that this is a one way enablement.
Once you set SPO mode, you will not be able to revert your tenant to OneDrive only Multi-Geo mode without an escalation with support.
____

=== To set a geo location into SPO Mode

To set a geo location into SPO mode, connect to the geo location you want to set in SPO Mode:

. Open your SharePoint Online Management Shell
. Connect-SPOService -URL "https://$tenantGeo-admin.sharepoint.com" -Credential $credential
. Set-SPOMultiGeoExperience</br></br> image:../media/Set-SPO-MultiGeo.jpg[Set-SPOMultiGeoExperience.]
. This operation usually takes about an hour while we perform various publish backs in the service and re-stamp your tenant.
After at least 1 hour, please perform a Get-SPOMultiGeoExperience.
This will show you whether this geo location is in SPO mode.</br></br> image:../media/Get-SPO-MultiGeo.jpg[Image of Set-SPOMultiGeoExperience.]

____
[!Note] Certain caches in the service update every 24 hours, so it is possible that for a period of up to 24 hours, your satellite geo may intermittently behave as if it was still in ODB mode.
This does not cause any technical issues.
