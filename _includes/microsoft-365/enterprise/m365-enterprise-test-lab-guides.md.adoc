== Microsoft 365 for enterprise Test Lab Guides

_This applies to both Microsoft 365 for enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise._

Test Lab Guides (TLGs) help you quickly learn about Microsoft products.
They provide prescriptive instructions to configure simplified but representative test environments.
You can use these environments for demonstration, customization, or creation of complex proofs of concept for the duration of a trial or paid subscription.

TLGs are designed to be modular.
They build upon each other to create multiple configurations that more closely match your learning or test configuration needs.
The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or scenario, so that you can better plan for hosting it in production.

You can also use TLGs to create representative environments to develop and test applications, also known as dev/test environments.

=== Base configuration

First, create a test environment for link:/microsoft-365-enterprise/[Microsoft 365 for enterprise].
You can create two different types of base configurations:

* xref:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.adoc[Lightweight base configuration] - Use this when you want to configure and demonstrate Microsoft 365 for enterprise features and capabilities in a cloud-only environment, which does not include any on-premises components.
* xref:simulated-ent-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.adoc[Simulated enterprise base configuration] - Use this when you want to configure and demonstrate Microsoft 365 for enterprise features and capabilities in a hybrid cloud environment, which uses on-premises components such as an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain.

You can also create test environments for Office 365 E5 by not adding the Microsoft 365 E5 license to your trial or production test environment.
