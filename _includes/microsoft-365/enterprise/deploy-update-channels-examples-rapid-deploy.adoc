== Example of broad deployment for the latest releases

This channel configuration example is for an organization that uses
rapid deployment of the latest releases to fit these business
priorities:

* Ensure business continuity with Microsoft apps and services.
* Maximize device, service, and data security with the latest features
and fixes from Microsoft.
* Maximize user productivity with the latest features from Microsoft.

These goals translate to the IT task of finding the balance between
rapid production deployment and early vetting with a representative
subset of users and devices to validate functionally before broad
deployment.

Our example organization has 5,000 employees in buildings across the
world in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 70% of the employees
use Microsoft 365 E3 and the rest of the organization uses Microsoft 365
E5.

____
[!Note] This example is designed to show you how you can use deployment
stages and groups, which can work for organizations of many types and
sizes.
____

This organization’s IT infrastructure:

* Is largely homogeneous, with Windows, Microsoft 365 Apps, and
Microsoft cloud services comprising 60% of the installed base. A few
legacy systems remain after an intensive, multi-year effort to simplify
and streamline the IT infrastructure.
* Is maintained by highly experienced staff and tasked with keeping
users and their devices productive and secure by following Microsoft’s
lead in their releases.

=== Deployment and update stages

Based on rapid deployment goals of the latest release, this example
organization uses a two-step deployment process.

[arabic]
. *Use a preview or pilot deployment:* Validate and iterate with early
adopters, IT staff, users with representative configurations, and
training staff.
+
The early adopters, IT staff, users with representative configurations
can validate functionality with other apps and on devices before the new
features roll out to the rest of the organization.
+
Change managers have an early peek at the new features before widespread
rollout and can plan messaging and rollout.
+
Training staff can plan new internal courses or update existing courses
for the new features before widespread rollout.
. *Production deployment:* Roll out to all remaining users by region,
department, or other deployment method.

=== Deployment configuration for Windows 10

The overall goal is to perform a broad deployment of the latest
Semi-Annual Channel release after validation of Release Preview Channel
changes by a group of representative users and their devices.

See link:/windows/deployment/[Windows 10 deployment] for more
information on Windows 10 deployment methods and strategies.

Win10ReleasePreviewChannel group.

This organization uses the best practice of deploying the Release
Preview Channel payload in the same way as they deploy Semi-Annual
Channel releases, such as Windows Update or Windows Server Update
Services, and that they apply the same policies for both channel
updates.

Ongoing updates process:

[arabic]
. Release Preview Channel changes are deployed to the
Win10ReleasePreviewChannel (example name) deployment group.
. Win10ReleasePreviewChannel group members confirm that Release Preview
Channel changes are working to IT deployment staff, who can provide
feedback to Microsoft and wait for the next Release Preview Channel
changes for additional validation.
. Semi-Annual Channel feature changes are deployed to the
Win10SemiAnnualChannel deployment group.

____
[!Note] While the Semi-Annual Channel is the recommended channel, your
IT department should utilize their management tools and determine when
to deploy the latest Semi-Annual Channel release within their
organization and then roll it out in waves.

=== Deployment configuration for Microsoft 365 Apps

The overall goal is to perform a broad deployment of the latest Current
Channel release after validation of Current Channel (Preview) changes by
a group of representative users.

See link:/deployoffice/plan-office-365-proplus[Microsoft 365 Apps
deployment] for more information on Microsoft 365 Apps deployment
methods and strategies.

group.

| | |

Ongoing updates process:

[arabic]
. Current Channel (Preview) changes are deployed to the
AppsCurrentChannelPreview deployment group.
. AppsCurrentChannelPreview group members confirm that Current Channel
(Preview) changes are working to IT deployment staff, who can provide
feedback to Microsoft and wait for the next Current Channel (Preview)
release for additional validation.
. Current Channel changes are deployed to the AppsCurrentChannel
deployment group.
