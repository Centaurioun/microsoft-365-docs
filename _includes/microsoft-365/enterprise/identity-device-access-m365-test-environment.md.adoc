== Identity and device access for your Microsoft 365 test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environments._

xref:../security/office-365-security/microsoft-365-policies-configurations.adoc[Identity and device access configurations] are a set of recommended configurations and conditional access policies to protect access to all services that are integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

To create a test environment that has the common identity and device access configurations in place:

. Configure your test environment with the prerequisite identity and security features based on your choice of identity model and authentication method:

* xref:cloud-only-prereqs-m365-test-environment.adoc[Cloud only]
* xref:phs-prereqs-m365-test-environment.adoc[Password hash synchronization (PHS)]
* xref:pta-prereqs-m365-test-environment.adoc[Pass-through authentication (PTA)]

. Use xref:../security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies.adoc[Common identity and device access policies] to configure the policies that build on the prerequisites configured for your test environment and explore and verify protection for identities and devices.
