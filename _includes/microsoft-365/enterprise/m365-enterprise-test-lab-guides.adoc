== Microsoft 365 for enterprise Test Lab Guides

_This applies to both Microsoft 365 for enterprise and Office 365
Enterprise._

Test Lab Guides (TLGs) help you quickly learn about Microsoft products.
They provide prescriptive instructions to configure simplified but
representative test environments. You can use these environments for
demonstration, customization, or creation of complex proofs of concept
for the duration of a trial or paid subscription.

TLGs are designed to be modular. They build upon each other to create
multiple configurations that more closely match your learning or test
configuration needs. The ``I built it out myself and it works'' hands-on
experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new
product or scenario, so that you can better plan for hosting it in
production.

You can also use TLGs to create representative environments to develop
and test applications, also known as dev/test environments.

=== Base configuration

First, create a test environment for
link:/microsoft-365-enterprise/[Microsoft 365 for enterprise]. You can
create two different types of base configurations:

* link:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[Lightweight
base configuration] - Use this when you want to configure and
demonstrate Microsoft 365 for enterprise features and capabilities in a
cloud-only environment, which does not include any on-premises
components.
* link:simulated-ent-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[Simulated
enterprise base configuration] - Use this when you want to configure and
demonstrate Microsoft 365 for enterprise features and capabilities in a
hybrid cloud environment, which uses on-premises components such as an
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain.

You can also create test environments for Office 365 E5 by not adding
the Microsoft 365 E5 license to your trial or production test
environment.
