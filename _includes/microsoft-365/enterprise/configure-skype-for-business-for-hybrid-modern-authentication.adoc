== How to configure Skype for Business on-premises to use Hybrid Modern Authentication

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365
Enterprise._

Modern Authentication, is a method of identity management that offers
more secure user authentication and authorization, is available for
Skype for Business server on-premises and Exchange server on-premises,
and split-domain Skype for Business hybrids.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Would you like to know more about Modern Authentication
(MA) and why you might prefer to use it in your company or organization?
Check link:hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md[this document] for an
overview. If you need to know what Skype for Business topologies are
supported with MA, that’s documented here!
____

*Before we begin*, I use these terms:

* Modern Authentication (MA)
* Hybrid Modern Authentication (HMA)
* Exchange on-premises (EXCH)
* Exchange Online (EXO)
* Skype for Business on-premises (SFB)
* Skype for Business Online (SFBO)

Also, if a graphic in this article has an object that’s grayed-out or
dimmed that means the element shown in gray *isn’t* included in
MA-specific configuration.

=== Read the summary

This summary breaks down the process into steps that might otherwise get
lost during the execution, and is good for an overall checklist to keep
track of where you are in the process.

[arabic]
. First, make sure you meet all the prerequisites.
. Since many *prerequisites* are common for both Skype for Business and
Exchange, link:hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md[see the overview article
for your pre-req checklist]. Do this _before_ you begin any of the steps
in this article.
. Collect the HMA-specific info you’ll need in a file, or OneNote.
. Turn ON Modern Authentication for EXO (if it isn’t already turned on).
. Turn ON Modern Authentication for SFBO (if it isn’t already turned
on).
. Turn ON Hybrid Modern Authentication for Exchange on-premises.
. Turn ON Hybrid Modern Authentication for Skype for Business
on-premises.

These steps turn on MA for SFB, SFBO, EXCH, and EXO - that is, all the
products that can participate in an HMA configuration of SFB and SFBO
(including dependencies on EXCH/EXO). In other words, if your users are
homed in/have mailboxes created in any part of the Hybrid (EXO + SFBO,
EXO + SFB, EXCH + SFBO, or EXCH + SFB), your finished product will look
like this:

image::../media/ab89cdf2-160b-49ac-9b71-0160800acfc8.png[A Mixed 6 Skype
for business HMA topology has MA on in all four possible locations.]

As you can see there are four different places to turn on MA! For the
best user experience, we recommend you turn on MA in all four of these
locations. If you can’t turn MA on in all these locations, adjust the
steps so that you turn on MA only in the locations that are necessary
for your environment.

See the
link:/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/modern-authentication/topologies-supported[Supportability
topic for Skype for Business with MA] for supported topologies.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Double-check that you’ve met all the prerequisites before
you begin. You’ll find that information in
link:hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md[Hybrid modern authentication
overview and prerequisites].
____

=== Collect all HMA-specific info you’ll need

After you’ve double-checked that you meet the
link:hybrid-modern-auth-overview.md[prerequisites] to use Modern
Authentication (see the note above), you should create a file to hold
the info you’ll need for configuring HMA in the steps ahead. Examples
used in this article:

* *SIP/SMTP domain*
** Ex. contoso.com (is federated with Office 365)
* *Tenant ID*
** The GUID that represents your Office 365 tenant (at the login of
contoso.onmicrosoft.com).
* *SFB 2015 CU5 Web Service URLs*

You’ll need internal and external web service URLs for all SfB 2015
pools deployed. To obtain these, run the following from Skype for
Business Management Shell:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-CsService -WebServer | Select-Object PoolFqdn, InternalFqdn, ExternalFqdn | FL
----

* Ex. Internal: https://lyncwebint01.contoso.com
* Ex. External: https://lyncwebext01.contoso.com

If you’re using a Standard Edition server, the internal URL will be
blank. In this case, use the pool fqdn for the internal URL.

=== Turn on Modern Authentication for EXO

Follow the instructions here:
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32711.exchange-online-how-to-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx[Exchange
Online: How to enable your tenant for modern authentication.]

=== Turn on Modern Authentication for SFBO

Follow the instructions here:
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx[Skype
for Business Online: Enable your tenant for modern authentication].

=== Turn on Hybrid Modern Authentication for Exchange on-premises

Follow the instructions here:
link:configure-exchange-server-for-hybrid-modern-authentication.md[How
to configure Exchange Server on-premises to use Hybrid Modern
Authentication].

=== Turn on Hybrid Modern Authentication for Skype for Business on-premises

==== Add on-premises web service URLs as SPNs in Azure Active Directory

Now you’ll need to run commands to add the URLs (collected earlier) as
Service Principals in SFBO.

____
[!NOTE] Service principal names (SPNs) identify web services and
associate them with a security principal (such as an account name or
group) so that the service can act on the behalf of an authorized user.
Clients authenticating to a server make use of information that’s
contained in SPNs.
____

[arabic]
. First, connect to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with
link:/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview[these instructions].
. Run this command, on-premises, to get a list of SFB web service URLs.
+
Note that the AppPrincipalId begins with `00000004`. This corresponds to
Skype for Business Online.
+
Take note of (and screenshot for later comparison) the output of this
command, which will include an SE and WS URL, but mostly consist of SPNs
that begin with `00000004-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000/`.
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-MsolServicePrincipal -AppPrincipalId 00000004-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000 | Select -ExpandProperty ServicePrincipalNames
----
. If the internal *or* external SFB URLs from on-premises are missing
(for example, https://lyncwebint01.contoso.com and
https://lyncwebext01.contoso.com) we will need to add those specific
records to this list.
+
Be sure to replace _the example URLs_ below with your actual URLs in the
Add commands!
+
[source,powershell]
----
$x= Get-MsolServicePrincipal -AppPrincipalId 00000004-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000
$x.ServicePrincipalnames.Add("https://lyncwebint01.contoso.com/")
$x.ServicePrincipalnames.Add("https://lyncwebext01.contoso.com/")
Set-MSOLServicePrincipal -AppPrincipalId 00000004-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000 -ServicePrincipalNames $x.ServicePrincipalNames
----
. Verify your new records were added by running the
*Get-MsolServicePrincipal* command from step 2 again, and looking
through the output. Compare the list or screenshot from before to the
new list of SPNs. You might also screenshot the new list for your
records. If you were successful, you’ll see the two new URLs in the
list. Going by our example, the list of SPNs will now include the
specific URLs https://lyncwebint01.contoso.com and
https://lyncwebext01.contoso.com/.

==== Create the EvoSTS Auth Server Object

Run the following command in the Skype for Business Management Shell.

[source,powershell]
----
New-CsOAuthServer -Identity evoSTS -MetadataURL https://login.windows.net/common/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml -AcceptSecurityIdentifierInformation $true -Type AzureAD
----

==== Enable Hybrid Modern Authentication

This is the step that actually turns on MA. All the previous steps can
be run ahead of time without changing the client authentication flow.
When you’re ready to change the authentication flow, run this command in
the Skype for Business Management Shell.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-CsOAuthConfiguration -ClientAuthorizationOAuthServerIdentity evoSTS
----

=== Verify

Once you enable HMA, a client’s next login will use the new auth flow.
Note that just turning on HMA won’t trigger a reauthentication for any
client. The clients reauthenticate based on the lifetime of the auth
tokens and/or certs they have.

To test that HMA is working after you’ve enabled it, sign out of a test
SFB Windows client and be sure to click `delete my credentials'. Sign in
again. The client should now use the Modern Auth flow and your login
will now include an *Office 365* prompt for a `Work or school' account,
seen right before the client contacts the server and logs you in.

You should also check the `Configuration Information' for Skype for
Business Clients for an `OAuth Authority'. To do this on your client
computer, hold down the CTRL key at the same time you right-click the
Skype for Business Icon in the Windows Notification tray. Click
*Configuration Information* in the menu that appears. In the `Skype for
Business Configuration Information' window that will appear on the
desktop, look for the following:

:::image type=``content'' alt-text=``The Configuration information of a
Skype for Business Client using Modern Authentication shows a Lync and
EWS OAUTH Authority URL of
https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize.''
source=``../media/4e54edf5-c8f8-4e7f-b032-5d413b0232de.png'':::

You should also hold down the CTRL key at the same time you right-click
the icon for the Outlook client (also in the Windows Notifications tray)
and click `Connection Status'. Look for the client’s SMTP address
against an AuthN type of `Bearer*', which represents the bearer token
used in OAuth.
