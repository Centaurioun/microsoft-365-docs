== Client and server software roadmap for Microsoft 365

Most enterprise organizations have a heterogeneous environment that
includes multiple releases of operating systems, client software, and
server software. Microsoft 365 for Enterprise includes the most secure
versions of the key components of your IT infrastructure. It also
includes productivity features that are designed to take advantage of
cloud technologies.

To maximize the business value of the Microsoft 365 for Enterprise
integrated suite of products, begin planning and implementing a strategy
to migrate releases of:

* The Office client installed on your computers to Microsoft 365 Apps
for enterprise.
* The Office servers installed on your servers to their equivalent
services in Microsoft 365.
* Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on your devices to Windows 10 Enterprise.

[!Note] Support for Windows 7 ended on _January 14, 2020_. For more
information, see the
https://support.microsoft.com/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020[end-of-support
details].

As you accomplish these migrations over time, your organization comes
closer to the vision of the
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/04/27/making-it-simpler-with-a-modern-workplace/[modern
workplace]. This secure and integrated environment can help you unlock
teamwork and creativity in your organization. Microsoft 365 for
Enterprise enables and empowers you all along the way.

=== Migration for Office client products

Organizations both large and small often use a combination of older
versions of Office client products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
These older versions:

* Can be
https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5[updated]
with the latest security updates and support fixes. But the process is
sometimes manual and might not scale across your organization.
* Aren’t optimized to use the Microsoft cloud technologies that help you
digitally transform your business.
* Don’t provide the latest features.

Microsoft 365 for Enterprise includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.
This version of the Office client products is available with a Microsoft
365 for Enterprise license. It’s installed and updated from the
Microsoft cloud. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise includes security
updates and the latest features. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/about-microsoft-365-apps[About Microsoft 365 Apps for
enterprise].

==== Office 2007

For versions of Office in the Office 2007 release, the end of support
has already passed. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/office-2007-end-support-roadmap[Office 2007
end-of-support roadmap].

Rather than upgrading your computers that run Office 2007 to Office
2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016, consider taking the following steps:

[arabic]
. Get and assign a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
. Uninstall Office 2007 on their computers.
. Install Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or
during an IT rollout. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps[Deployment guide
for Microsoft 365 Apps].

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs updates automatically. It can
take advantage of cloud-based services for enhanced security and
productivity.

==== Office 2010

For versions of Office in the Office 2010 release, support ended on
_October 13, 2020_. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/office-2010-end-support-roadmap[Office 2010
end-of-support roadmap].

You might consider upgrading your computers that run Office 2010 to
Office 2013 or Office 2016. However, both of those versions must be
manually updated. So consider taking the following steps instead:

[arabic]
. Get and assign a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
. Uninstall Office 2010 on their computers.
. Install Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or
during an IT rollout. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps[Deployment guide
for Microsoft 365 Apps].

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise automatically installs both security
updates and new feature updates. It can take advantage of cloud-based
services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

==== Office 2013 and Office 2016

See the link:/lifecycle/products/microsoft-office-2013[end-of-support
roadmap for Office 2013]. The end of support for Office 2016 hasn’t yet
been determined. In these versions, like Office 2010, you must still
https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5[install
security updates]. This task might not scale well, depending on the size
of your organization.

Rather than keeping your computers current with the latest security
updates for Office 2013 or Office 2016, or updating your computers from
Office 2013 to Office 2016, consider taking the following steps:

[arabic]
. Get and assign a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
. Uninstall Office 2013 or Office 2016 on their computers.
. Install Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or
during an IT rollout. For more information, see
link:/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps[Deployment guide
for Microsoft 365 Apps].

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs both security updates and new
feature updates automatically. It can take advantage of cloud-based
services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

=== Migration for Office server products

Both large and small organizations often use a combination of older
versions of the Office server products, such as Exchange Server and
SharePoint Server. These older versions:

* Should be updated with the latest security updates and support fixes.
In some cases, these updates are released monthly.
* Aren’t optimized to use the Microsoft cloud technologies that help you
digitally transform your business.
* Don’t include new productivity applications, such as Microsoft Teams.
* Don’t include the latest security features, such as Exchange and
Defender for Office 365.

Microsoft 365 for Enterprise includes cloud-based versions of Office
server services that use some of the same tools as on-premises versions
of Office server software, such as web browsers and the Outlook client.
These services are automatically updated for security. So your IT
personnel save the time it takes to maintain and update on-premises
servers. These services also offer new feature enhancements that aren’t
present in Office server software.
