== Microsoft 365 endpoints

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise._

Endpoints are the set of destination IP addresses, DNS domain names, and URLs for Microsoft 365 traffic on the Internet.

To optimize performance to Microsoft 365 cloud-based services, these endpoints need special handling by your client browsers and the devices in your edge network.
These devices include firewalls, SSL Break and Inspect and packet inspection devices, and  data loss prevention systems.

See xref:managing-office-365-endpoints.adoc[Managing Microsoft 365 endpoints] for the details.

There are currently five different Microsoft 365 clouds.
This table takes you to the list of endpoints for each one.
