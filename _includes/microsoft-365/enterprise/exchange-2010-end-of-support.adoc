== Exchange 2010 end of support roadmap

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365
Enterprise._

Exchange Server 2010 reached its end of support on *October 13, 2020*.
If you haven’t already begun your migration from Exchange 2010 to
Microsoft 365, Office 365, or Exchange 2016, now’s the time to start
planning.

=== What does _end of support_ mean?

Most Microsoft products have a support lifecycle during which they get
new features, bug fixes, security fixes, and so on. This lifecycle
typically lasts for 10 years from the product’s initial release. The end
of this lifecycle is known as the product’s end of support. Because
Exchange 2010 reached its end of support on October 13, 2020, Microsoft
no longer provides:

* Technical support for problems that may occur.
* Bug fixes for issues that may impact the stability and usability of
the server.
* Security fixes for vulnerabilities that may make the server vulnerable
to security breaches.
* Time zone updates.

Your installation of Exchange 2010 will continue to run after this date.
But because of the changes listed above, we strongly recommend that you
migrate from Exchange 2010 as soon as possible.

For more information about nearing the end of support, see
link:upgrade-from-office-2010-servers-and-products.md[Resources to help
you upgrade from Office 2010 servers and clients].

=== What are my options?

It’s a great time to explore your options and prepare a migration plan.
You can:

* Migrate fully to Microsoft 365. Migrate mailboxes using cutover,
minimal hybrid, or full hybrid migration. Then remove on-premises
Exchange servers and Active Directory.
* Migrate your Exchange 2010 servers to Exchange 2016 on your
on-premises servers.

____
[!IMPORTANT] If your organization chooses to migrate mailboxes to
Microsoft 365 but plans to keep DirSync or Azure AD Connect in place to
continue managing user accounts from on-premises Active Directory, you
need to keep at least one Microsoft Exchange server on-premises. If you
remove all Exchange servers, you won’t be able to make changes to
Exchange recipients in Exchange Online because the source of authority
remains in your on-premises Active Directory. Changes need to be made
there. In this scenario, you have the following options:

* _Recommended:_ If you migrated your mailboxes to Microsoft 365 and
upgraded your servers by October 13, 2020, use Exchange 2010 to connect
to Microsoft 365 and migrate mailboxes. Next, migrate Exchange 2010 to
Exchange 2016, and decommission any remaining Exchange 2010 servers.
* If you didn’t complete the mailbox migration and on-premises server
upgrade by October 13, 2020, upgrade your on-premises Exchange 2010
servers to Exchange 2016 first. Then use Exchange 2016 to connect to
Microsoft 365 and migrate mailboxes.
____

____
[!NOTE] It’s little more complicated, but you can also migrate mailboxes
to Microsoft 365 while migrating your on-premises Exchange 2010 servers
to Exchange 2016.
____

Here are the three paths you can take to avoid the end of support for
Exchange Server 2010.

image::../media/exchange-2010-end-of-support/exchange-2010-end-of-support-options.png[Exchange
Server 2010 upgrade paths.]

The following sections explore each option in more detail.

=== Migrate to Microsoft 365

Migrating your email to Microsoft 365 is the best and simplest option to
help you retire your Exchange 2010 deployment. With a migration to
Microsoft 365, you can make a single hop from old technology to current
features, including:

* Compliance capabilities such as Retention Policies, In-Place and
Litigation Hold, in-place eDiscovery, and more.
* Microsoft Teams.
* Power BI.
* Focused Inbox.
* MyAnalytics.

Microsoft 365 also gets new features and experiences first, so your
organization can start using them right away. Also, you won’t have to
worry about:

* Purchasing and maintaining hardware.
* Paying to heat and cool your servers.
* Keeping up to date on security, product, and time-zone fixes.
* Maintaining storage and software to support compliance requirements.
* Upgrading to a new version of Exchange. You’re always on the latest
version of Exchange in Microsoft 365.

==== How should I migrate to Microsoft 365?

Depending on your organization, you have a few options to get to
Microsoft 365. First, you need to consider a few things, such as:

* The number of seats or mailboxes you need to move.
* How long you want the migration to last.
* Whether you need a seamless integration between your on-premises
installation and Microsoft 365 during the migration.

This table shows your migration options and the most important factors
that determine which method to use.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Migration option |Organization size |Duration
|Cutover migration |Fewer than 150 seats |A week or less
|Minimal hybrid migration |Fewer than 150 seats |A few weeks or less
|Full hybrid migration |More than 150 seats |A few weeks or more
|===

The following sections give you an overview of these methods. For more
information, see
https://support.office.com/article/Decide-on-a-migration-path-0d4f2396-9cef-43b8-9bd6-306d01df1e27[Decide
on a migration path].

==== Cutover migration

In a cutover migration, you migrate all your mailboxes, distribution
groups, contacts, and so on, to Office 365 at a set date and time. When
you’re done, you shut down your on-premises Exchange servers and start
using Microsoft 365 exclusively.

Cutover migration is great for small organizations that don’t have many
mailboxes, want to get to Microsoft 365 quickly, and don’t want to deal
with the complexity of the other methods. But it should be completed in
a week or less. And it requires users to reconfigure their Outlook
profiles. Cutover migration can migrate up to 2,000 mailboxes, but we
recommend you use it for a maximum of 150. If you try to migrate more,
you could run out of time to transfer all the mailboxes before your
deadline, and your IT support staff may get overwhelmed with requests to
help users reconfigure Outlook.

Here are things to consider about cutover migration:

* Microsoft 365 will need to connect to your Exchange 2010 servers by
using Outlook Anywhere over TCP port 443.
* All on-premises mailboxes will be moved to Microsoft 365.
* You’ll need an on-premises administrator account that has read access
to your users’ mailboxes.
* The Exchange 2010 accepted domains that you want to use in Microsoft
365 need to be added as verified domains in the service.
* Between when you start the migration and when you begin the completion
phase, Microsoft 365 will periodically synchronize the Microsoft 365 and
on-premises mailboxes. This lets you complete the migration without
worrying about email being left behind in your on-premises mailboxes.
* Users will receive new temporary passwords for their Microsoft 365
account. They’ll need to change those when they sign in to their
mailboxes for the first time.
* You’ll need a Microsoft 365 license that includes Exchange Online for
each user mailbox you migrate.
* Users will need to set up a new Outlook profile on each of their
devices and download their email again. The amount of email that Outlook
will download can vary. For more information, see
https://support.microsoft.com/office/f3a1251c-6dd5-4208-aef9-7c8c9522d633[Work
offline in Outlook].

you need to know about a cutover email migration]
* link:/Exchange/mailbox-migration/cutover-migration-to-office-365[Perform
a cutover migration of email to Office 365]

==== Minimal hybrid migration

In a minimal hybrid, or express, migration you move a few hundred
mailboxes to Microsoft 365 within a few weeks. This method doesn’t
support advanced hybrid-migration features like shared free/busy
calendar information.

Minimal hybrid migration is great for organizations that need to take
more time to migrate their mailboxes to Microsoft 365, but still plan to
complete the migration within a few weeks. You get some of the benefits
of the more advanced _full-hybrid migration_ without much of the
complexity. You can control how many and which mailboxes to migrate at a
given time. Microsoft 365 mailboxes will be created with the user names
and passwords of the on-premises accounts. And, unlike cutover
migrations, your users don’t have to recreate their Outlook profiles.

Here are things to consider about minimal hybrid migration:

* You’ll need to do a one-time directory synchronization between your
on-premises Active Directory servers and Microsoft 365.
* Users will be able to sign in to their Microsoft 365 mailbox with the
same user name and password as before their mailbox.
* You’ll need a Microsoft 365 license that includes Exchange Online for
each user mailbox that you migrate.
* Users won’t need to set up a new Outlook profile on most of their
devices, though some older Android phones might need a new profile.
Users won’t need to redownload their email.

For more information, see
link:/Exchange/mailbox-migration/use-minimal-hybrid-to-quickly-migrate[Use
Minimal Hybrid to quickly migrate Exchange mailboxes to Office 365].

==== Full hybrid

In a full hybrid migration, you have many hundreds, up to tens of
thousands, of mailboxes, and you move some or all to Microsoft 365.
Because these migrations are typically longer-term, hybrid migrations
make it possible to:

* Show on-premises users the free/busy calendar information for users in
Microsoft 365, and vice versa.
* See a unified global address list that contains recipients in both
on-premises and Microsoft 365.
* View full Outlook recipient properties for all users, regardless of
whether they’re on-premises or in Microsoft 365.
* Secure email communication between on-premises Exchange servers and
Office 365 using TLS and certificates.
* Treat messages sent between on-premises Exchange servers and Microsoft
365 as internal, enabling them to:
** Be properly evaluated and processed by transport and compliance
agents targeting internal messages.
** Bypass anti-spam filters.

Full hybrid migrations are best for organizations that expect to stay in
a hybrid configuration for many months or more. You get the features
listed earlier in this section, plus directory synchronization, better
integrated compliance features, and the ability to move mailboxes to and
from Microsoft 365 using online mailbox moves. Microsoft 365 becomes an
extension of your on-premises organization.

Things to consider about full-hybrid migration:

* They aren’t suited to all organizations. Due to the complexity of full
hybrid migrations, organizations with less than a few hundred mailboxes
don’t typically see benefits that justify the effort and cost involved.
In such cases, we recommend that you consider cutover or minimal hybrid
migration instead.
* You need to set up directory synchronization using Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD) Connect between your on-premises Active Directory
servers and Microsoft 365.
* Users will be able to sign in to their Microsoft 365 mailbox with same
user name and password they use when they sign in to the local network.
(This functionality requires Azure AD Connect with password
synchronization and/or Active Directory Federation Services).
* You need a Microsoft 365 license that includes Exchange Online for
each user mailbox you migrate.
* Users don’t need to set up a new Outlook profile on most of their
devices, although some older Android phones might need a new profile.
Users won’t need to redownload their email.

____
[!IMPORTANT] If your organization chooses to migrate mailboxes to
Microsoft 365 but plans to keep DirSync or Azure AD Connect in place to
continue managing user accounts from on-premises Active Directory, you
need to keep at least one Exchange server on-premises. If all Exchange
servers are removed, you won’t be able to make changes to Exchange
recipients in Exchange Online. This is because the source of authority
remains in your on-premises Active Directory and changes need to be made
there.

=== Upgrade to a newer version of Exchange Server on-premises

We strongly believe that you get the best value and user experience by
migrating fully to Microsoft 365. But we understand that some
organizations need to keep some Exchange Servers on-premises. This might
be because of regulatory requirements, to guarantee data isn’t stored in
a foreign datacenter, because you have unique settings or requirements
that can’t be met in the cloud, or because you need Exchange to manage
cloud mailboxes because you still use Active Directory on-premises. In
any case, if you keep Exchange on-premises, you should ensure your
Exchange 2010 environment is upgraded to at least Exchange 2013 or
Exchange 2016.

For the best experience, we recommend that you upgrade your remaining
on-premises environment to Exchange 2016. You don’t need to install
Exchange Server 2013 if you want to go straight from Exchange Server
2010 to Exchange Server 2016.

Exchange 2016 includes all the features of previous releases of
Exchange. It most closely matches the experience available with
Microsoft 365, although some features are available only in Microsoft
365. Check out just a few of the things you’ve been missing:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Exchange release |Features
|*Exchange 2013* |Simplified architecture reduces the number of server
roles to three (Mailbox, Client Access, Edge Transport)

| |Data loss prevention policies (DLP) that help keep sensitive
information from leaking

| |Improved Outlook Web App experience

|*Exchange 2016* |_Features from Exchange 2013 and …_

| |Further simplified server roles to just Mailbox and Edge Transport

| |Improved DLP along with integration with SharePoint

| |Improved database resilience

| |Online document collaboration
|===

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Consideration |More information
|End of support dates |Like Exchange 2010, each version of Exchange has
its own end-of-support date: Exchange 2013 - April 2023 Exchange 2016 -
October 2025 The earlier the end-of-support date, the sooner you’ll need
to perform another migration. April 2023 is a lot closer than you think!

|Migration path to Exchange 2013 or 2016 |The migration path from
Exchange 2010 to a newer version is the same whether you choose Exchange
2013 or Exchange 2016: Install Exchange 2013 or 2016 into your existing
Exchange 2010 organization. Move services and other infrastructure to
Exchange 2013 or 2016. Move mailboxes and public folders to Exchange
2013 or 2016 Decommission remaining Exchange 2010 servers.

|Version coexistence |When migrating to Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016,
you can install either version into an existing Exchange 2010
organization. This enables you to install one or more Exchange 2013 or
Exchange 2016 servers and do your migration.

|Server hardware |Server hardware requirements have changed from
Exchange 2010. Make sure your hardware is compatible. Find out more
about hardware requirements for each version here:
link:/Exchange/plan-and-deploy/system-requirements?view=exchserver-2016&preserve-view=true[Exchange
2016 system requirements]
link:/Exchange/exchange-2013-system-requirements-exchange-2013-help[Exchange
2013 system requirements] With the significant improvements in Exchange
performance and the increased computing power and storage capacity in
newer servers, you’ll likely need fewer servers to support the same
number of mailboxes.

|Operating system version |The minimum supported operating system
versions for each version are: Exchange 2016 - Windows Server 2012
Exchange 2013 - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 You can find more information
about operating system support at
link:/exchange/plan-and-deploy/supportability-matrix[Exchange
Supportability Matrix].

|Active Directory forest functional level |The minimum supported Active
Directory forest functional levels for each version are: Exchange 2016 -
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Exchange 2013 - Windows Server 2003 You can
find more information about forest functional level support at
link:/exchange/plan-and-deploy/supportability-matrix[Exchange
Supportability Matrix].

|Office client versions |The minimum supported Office client versions
for each version are: Exchange 2016 - Office 2010 (with the latest
updates) Exchange 2013 - Office 2007 SP3 Find more information about
Office client support at
