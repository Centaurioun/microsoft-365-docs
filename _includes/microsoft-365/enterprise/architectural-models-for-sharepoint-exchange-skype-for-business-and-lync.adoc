== Architectural models for SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for Business, and Lync

The IT posters in this article describe the architectural models and
deployment options for SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for Business, and
Lync. They also provide design information for deploying SharePoint in
Microsoft Azure.

By using Microsoft 365, you can provide familiar collaboration and
communication services through the cloud. With a few exceptions, the
user experience remains the same whether you’re maintaining an
on-premises deployment or using Microsoft 365.

This unified user experience complicates the decision of where to place
each workload. It also raises questions:

* How do you choose a platform for individual workloads?
* Does it make sense to keep any service on-premises?
* In what scenario is a hybrid deployment appropriate?
* How does Azure fit into the picture?
* What configurations of Office server workloads does Azure support?
