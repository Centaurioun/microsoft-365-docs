_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise._

Office 2010 and Exchange 2010 reached their end of support on *October 13, 2020*.

SharePoint 2010 and Project Server 2010 will reach their end of support on *April 13, 2021*.

While you plan your upgrade, consider moving to Microsoft 365.

They're updated with new productivity and security features regularly from the Microsoft cloud.
