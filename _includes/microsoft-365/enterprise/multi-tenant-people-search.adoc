== Microsoft 365 Multi-Tenant Organization People Search (private preview)

The Multi-Tenant Organization (MTO) People Search is a collaboration
feature that enables search and discovery of people across multiple
tenants. A tenant admin can enable cross-tenant synchronization that
will allow users to be synced to another tenant and be discoverable in
its global address list. Once enabled, users will be able to search and
discover synced user profiles from the other tenant and view their
corresponding people cards.

____
[!NOTE] This Private Preview program is designed to offer select
customers the opportunity to try out the multi-tenant people search
feature. You can then validate the scenario and provide feedback to the
product development team. The purpose of this article is to:

* Give an overview of the feature
* Define use cases that we currently support as part of the preview
* Provide instructions on how you can configure and test the feature

target tenant, _Contoso_. Nestor from Contoso would like to search and
view Megan’s people card in Teams. After Megan’s account has been
synced, Nestor can search and discover Megan’s people card in any of the
Microsoft 365 apps.

=== Known limitations

* The Microsoft Teams audio and video call buttons will direct the call
to the user’s home tenant Teams instance (Fabrikam) and not the Teams
instance target tenant (Contoso).
* The current experience provides limited information on the people card
(basic contact information, job title and office location).

=== Prerequisites

To test the MTO People Search feature, it is assumed that you already
have the following settings:

* Two Azure AD/Microsoft 365 tenants
* Both tenants have the *Azure AD Cross-tenant Synchronization* feature
enabled (currently in private preview - make sure you sign up for both
preview features)
* Provisioned users from home to target tenants as described in
https://github.com/ArvindHarinder1/CrossTenantSynchronization/blob/main/CrossTenantSynchronization.md[Instructions
to enable Tenant-to-Tenant Sync]

=== Use Cases

Multi-tenant organization people search is supported across a range of
scenarios and Microsoft 365 applications. Some of the scenarios you can
test and validate are described below:

[arabic]
. *Microsoft Outlook (OWA, desktop and mobile app)*
* Nestor (nestor@contoso.com) searches for ``Megan'' on the centralized
search bar in OWA and gets the results and can view Megan’s people card
with limited profile information.
* Nestor types in ``Megan'' in the _To_ line of the email and can send
an email to Megan after getting the results for megan@fabrikam.com.
* Nestor @mentions ``Megan'' in the body of the email and can get the
result for megan@fabrikam.com.
* Nestor types in ``Megan'' in the _cc_ line of the email and can get
the result for megan@fabrikam.com.
* Nestor can hover and/or click on Megan’s profile picture/initials to
view Megan’s limited people card.
. *Microsoft OneDrive/Sharepoint*
* Nestor (nestor@contoso.com) searches for ``Megan'' in the centralized
search bar on SharePoint and can get the result for megan@fabrikam.com.
* Nestor can hover and/or click on Megan’s profile picture/initials to
view Megan’s limited people card.
* Nestor can share and collaborate on Office documents with Megan.
. *Microsoft Teams (Web, desktop and mobile app)*
* Nestor (nestor@contoso.com) searches for ``Megan'' on the Teams people
picker and can view Megan’s limited people card.
* Nestor searches for ``Megan'' on the Teams power bar and can view
Megan’s limited people card Team membership.
. *Bing for Business*
* Nestor (nestor@contoso.com) searches for ``Megan'' on the search bar
and can view Megan’s limited people card (megan@fabrikam.com).

=== Key terminology

* _Home tenant_: The tenant you want to search from. The direction of
the search is _outbound_.
* _Resource tenant_: The tenant you want to search in. The direction of
the search is _inbound_.
+
A tenant can be both home and resource tenant simultaneously.
* _Cross-Tenant synchronization_ is a feature that enables multi-tenant
organizations to grant users access to applications in other tenants
within the organization. It achieves this by synchronizing internal
member users from a home tenant into a resource tenant as external B2B
users.
