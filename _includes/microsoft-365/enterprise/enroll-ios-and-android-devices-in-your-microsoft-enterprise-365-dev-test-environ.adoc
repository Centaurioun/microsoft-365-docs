== Enroll iOS and Android devices in your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise
test environments._

This article describes how to enroll and test basic mobile device
management capabilities for iOS/iPadOS and Android devices in your
Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment.

Enrolling iOS/iPadOS and Android devices in your test environment
involves three phases: -

=== Phase 1: Build out your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

If you want to enroll iOS/iPadOS and Android devices in a lightweight
way with the minimum requirements, follow the instructions in
link:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[Lightweight
base configuration].

If you want to enroll iOS/iPadOS and Android devices in a simulated
enterprise, follow the instructions in
link:pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md[Pass-through
authentication].

____
[!NOTE] Testing automated licensing and group membership doesn’t require
the simulated enterprise test environment, which includes a simulated
intranet connected to the internet and directory synchronization for an
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest. It’s provided here as
an option so that you can test automated licensing and group membership,
and you can experiment with it in an environment that represents a
typical organization.

=== Phase 2: Enroll your iOS and Android devices

If you’re considering a mobile device management (MDM) solution to
manage your devices, you can use Microsoft Intune. When working with any
MDM provider, including Intune, devices are ``enrolled''. When enrolled,
they receive the features and settings you configure.

In Intune, there are a few ways to enroll your iOS/iPadOS and Android
devices. You can choose the enrollment option that works best for your
organization. For more information and guidance, see the following
articles:

guide: Enroll iOS and iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune]
* link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android[Deployment
guide: Enroll Android devices in Microsoft Intune]

If you’re ready to use Intune for device management, and want some
guidance, then the following information may help:

Walkthrough Intune in Microsoft Endpoint Manager]
* link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-intune-setup[Deployment
guide: Setup or move to Microsoft Intune]

=== Phase 3: Manage your iOS and Android devices remotely

Microsoft Intune provides remote lock and passcode reset feature. If
someone loses their device, you can remotely lock the device. If someone
forgets their passcode, you can remotely reset it.

* To remotely lock an iOS/iPadOS or Android device, see
link:/mem/intune/remote-actions/device-remote-lock[Remotely lock devices
with Intune].
* To remotely reset the passcode, see
link:/mem/intune/remote-actions/device-passcode-reset[Reset or remove a
device passcode in Intune].

For additional tasks you can run remotely, see
link:/mem/intune/remote-actions/device-management#available-device-actions[available
device actions].
