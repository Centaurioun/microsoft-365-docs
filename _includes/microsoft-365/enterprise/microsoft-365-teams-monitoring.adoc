Microsoft Teams monitoring supports the following organizational
scenarios with near real-time information:

scenarios for Teams Monitoring.]

* *App Launch*. The number of times users opened the Teams client
without errors. Data is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.
* *Chat*. The number of chat messages sent and delivered in Teams. Data
is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.
* *Join Meeting*. The number of times users joined Teams meetings
without errors. Data is sampled and retrieved every 30 minutes.

Admins can use the information to correlate any Microsoft-reported
issues with the usage data to confirm any actual impact to their
organization. Also, admins can view any usage from the last two weeks of
usage data to identify any anomalies.
