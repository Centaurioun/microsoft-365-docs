== Test Microsoft 365 with Test Lab Guides (TLGs)

TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They’re great for
situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration
before you decide whether it’s right for you and before you begin the
design, planning, and rollout to users. The ``I built it out myself and
it works'' hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment
requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for
hosting it in production.

TLGs also create representative environments for development and testing
of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

=== Microsoft 365 dev/test environment

Use these articles to build your Microsoft 365 dev/test environment:

* link:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[The
lightweight base configuration]
+
Create a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription.
* link:simulated-ent-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[The
simulated enterprise base configuration]
+
Create a simplified intranet running in Microsoft Azure infrastructure
services and a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription.
+
This is optional and needed if you want to build a simulated enterprise
configuration for hybrid identity.

For additional TLGs that apply to both Office 365 and Microsoft 365, go
