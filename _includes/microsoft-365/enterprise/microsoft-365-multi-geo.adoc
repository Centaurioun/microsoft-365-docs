== Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo

The Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo Capabilities add-on provides customers with
the ability to expand their Microsoft 365 presence to multiple
geographic regions or counties within a single existing Microsoft 365
_Tenant_. Multi-Geo enables customers to manage data-at-rest locations
at a granular level for their users, SharePoint sites, Microsoft 365
Groups, and Microsoft Teams teams level. Multi-Geo is targeted to
customers who have a need to store customer data in multiple geographies
at the same time to satisfy their data residency requirements and whose
needs may change over time.

=== Multi-Geo architecture

In a Multi-Geo environment, your Microsoft 365 _Tenant_ consists of a
central location (where your Microsoft 365 subscription was originally
provisioned) and one or more satellite locations. In a Multi-Geo enabled
_Tenant_, the information about geo locations, groups, and user
information, is mastered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Because
your _Tenant_ information is mastered centrally and synchronized into
each geo location, sharing and experiences involving anyone from your
company contain global awareness.

=== Licensing

Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo is available as an add-on to the following
Microsoft 365 subscription plans for Enterprise Agreement customers.
Customers must purchase a number of Multi-Geo licenses equal to or
greater than 5% of their total eligible seats. User subscription
licenses must be on the same Enterprise Agreement as the Multi-Geo
Services licenses. Please contact your Microsoft account team for

* OneDrive for Business Plan 1 or Plan 2

=== Getting started

Follow these steps to get started with Multi-Geo:

[arabic]
. Work with your account team to add the _Multi-Geo Capabilities in
Microsoft 365_ service plan. They will guide you to add the number of
licenses needed. Multi-Geo feature is available to Enterprise Agreement
customers.
. Before you can start using Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, Microsoft needs to
configure your Exchange Online _Tenant_ for Multi-Geo support. This
one-time configuration process is triggered after you order the
_Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365_ service plan and the licenses
show up in your _Tenant_. You will receive workload-specific
notifications in the
https://support.office.com/article/38FB3333-BFCC-4340-A37B-DEDA509C2093[Microsoft
365 message center] once your _Tenant_ has completed the configuration
process for each workload, and you then may begin configuring and using
your Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo capabilities. The time required to
configure a _Tenant_ for Multi-Geo support varies from _Tenant_ to
_Tenant_, but most _Tenants_ finish within a month after receipt of the
feature licenses. Larger or more complex _Tenants_ may require more time
to complete the configuration process. Please contact your account team
for details on your specific _Tenant_ should you require it.
