== Set up directory synchronization for Microsoft 365

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365
Enterprise._

Microsoft 365 uses an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to store
and manage identities for authentication and permissions to access
cloud-based resources.

If you have an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
domain or forest, you can synchronize your AD DS user accounts, groups,
and contacts with the Azure AD tenant of your Microsoft 365
subscription. This is hybrid identity for Microsoft 365. Here are its
components.

of directory synchronization for Microsoft 365.]

Azure AD Connect runs on an on-premises server and synchronizes your AD
DS with the Azure AD tenant. Along with directory synchronization, you
can also specify these authentication options:

* Password hash synchronization (PHS)
+
Azure AD performs the authentication itself.
* Pass-through authentication (PTA)
+
Azure AD has AD DS perform the authentication.
* Federated authentication
+
Azure AD refers the client computer requesting authentication to another
identity provider.

See link:plan-for-directory-synchronization.md[Hybrid identities] for
more information.

=== 1. Review prerequisites for Azure AD Connect

You get a free Azure AD subscription with your Microsoft 365
subscription. When you set up directory synchronization, you will
install Azure AD Connect on one of your on-premises servers.

For Microsoft 365 you’ll need to:

* Verify your on-premises domain. The Azure AD Connect wizard guides you
through this.
* Obtain the user names and passwords for the admin accounts of your
Microsoft 365 tenant and AD DS.

For your on-premises server on which you install Azure AD Connect,
you’ll need:

=== 2. Install Azure AD Connect and configure directory synchronization

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* The user name and password of a Microsoft 365 global admin
* The user name and password of an AD DS domain administrator
* Which authentication method (PHS, PTA, federated)
* Whether you want to use
