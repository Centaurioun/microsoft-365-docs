== Protect global administrator accounts in your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise
test environments._

You can prevent digital attacks on your organization by ensuring that
your administrator accounts are as secure as possible.

This article describes how to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
conditional access policies to protect global administrator accounts.

Protecting global administrator accounts in your Microsoft 365 for
enterprise test environment involves two phases: -

=== Phase 1: Build out your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

If you want to test global administrator account protection in a
lightweight way with the minimum requirements, follow the instructions
in
link:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[Lightweight
base configuration].

If you want to test global administrator account protection in a
simulated enterprise, follow the instructions in
link:pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md[Pass-through
authentication].

____
[!NOTE] Testing global administrator account protection does not require
the simulated enterprise test environment, which includes a simulated
intranet connected to the internet and directory synchronization for an
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). It is provided here as an
option so that you can test global administrator account protection and
experiment with it in an environment that represents a typical
organization.

=== Phase 2: Configure conditional access policies

First, create a new user account as a dedicated global administrator.

[arabic]
. On a separate tab, open the https://admin.microsoft.com/[Microsoft 365
admin center].
. Select *Users* > *Active users*, and then select *Add a user*.
. In the *Add user* pane, enter *DedicatedAdmin* in the *First name*,
*Display name*, and *Username* boxes.
. Select *Password*, select *Let me create the password*, and then enter
a strong password. Record the password for this new account in a secure
location.
. Select *Next*.
. In the *Assign product licenses* pane, select *Microsoft 365 E5*, and
then select *Next*.
. In the *Optional settings* pane, select *Roles* > *Admin center
access* > *Global admin* > *Next*.
. On the *You’re almost done* pane, select *Finish adding*, and then
select *Close*.

Next, create a new group named GlobalAdmins and add the DedicatedAdmin
account to it.

[arabic]
. On the *Microsoft 365 admin center* tab, select *Groups* in the left
navigation, and then select *Groups*.
. Select *Add a group*.
. In the *Choose a group type* pane, select *Security*, and then select
*Next*.
. In the *Set up the basics* pane, select *Create group*, and then
select *Close*.
. In the *Review and finish adding group* pane, enter *GlobalAdmins*,
and then select *Next*.
. In the list of groups, select the *GlobalAdmins* group.
. In the *GlobalAdmins* pane, select *Members*, and then select *View
all and manage members*.
. In the *GlobalAdmins* pane, select *Add members*, select the
*DedicatedAdmin* account and your global admin account, and then select
*Save* > *Close* > *Close*.

Next, create conditional access policies to require multi-factor
authentication for global administrator accounts and to deny
authentication if the sign-in risk is medium or high.

This first policy requires that all global administrator accounts use
MFA.

[arabic]
. In a new tab of your browser, go to https://portal.azure.com.
. Click *Azure Active Directory* > *Security* > *Conditional Access*.
. In the *Conditional access – Policies* pane, select *Baseline policy:
Require MFA for admins (preview)*.
. In the *Baseline policy* pane, select *Use policy immediately > Save*.

This second policy blocks access to global administrator account
authentication when the sign-in risk is medium or high.

[arabic]
. In the *Conditional access – Policies* pane, select *New policy*.
. In the *New* pane, enter *Global administrators* in *Name*.
. In the *Assignments* section, select *Users and groups*.
. On the *Include* tab of the *Users and groups* pane, select *Select
users and groups* > *Users and groups* > *Select*.
. In the *Select* pane, select the *GlobalAdmins* group, and then select
*Select* > *Done*.
. In the *Assignments* section, select *Conditions*.
. In the *Conditions* pane, select *Sign-in risk*, select *Yes* for
*Configure*, select *High* and *Medium*, and then select *Select* and
*Done*.
. In the *Access controls* section of the *New* pane, select *Grant*.
. In the *Grant* pane, select *Block access*, and then select *Select*.
. In the *New* pane, select *On* for *Enable policy*, and then select
*Create*.
. Close the *Azure portal* and *Microsoft 365 admin center* tabs.

To test the first policy, sign out and sign in with the DedicatedAdmin
account. You should be prompted to configure MFA. This demonstrates that
the first policy is being applied.
