== Tune Exchange Online performance

This article contains general tips and links to other resources that
tell you how to improve performance of Exchange Online, particularly in
front of a migration. This article is part of the
link:./network-planning-and-performance.md[Network planning and
performance tuning for Office 365] project.

=== Things to consider in order to improve Exchange Online performance

To improve the speed of migration and reduce your organizationâ€™s
bandwidth constraints for Exchange Online, consider the following:

* *Reduce mailbox sizes.* Smaller mailbox size improves migration speed.
* *Use the mailbox move capabilities with an Exchange hybrid
deployment.* With an Exchange hybrid deployment, offline mail (in the
form of .OST files) does not require re-download when migrating to
Exchange Online. This significantly reduces your download bandwidth
requirements.
* *Schedule mailbox moves to occur during periods of low Internet
traffic and low on-premises Exchange use.* When scheduling moves,
migration requests are submitted to the mailbox replication proxy and
may not take place immediately.
* *Use lean popouts for Outlook on the web.* Lean popouts provide
smaller, less memory-intensive versions of certain email messages in
Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer by rendering some components on the
server. For more information, see

lean popouts to reduce memory used when reading mail messages].

=== General advice

* Make certain that DNS lookup for outlook.office.com enters the
MS-datacenter at a logical entry location for your location.
* Research mailbox caching and choose the appropriate options (re.
caching period, shared mailbox caching, et cetera).
* Keep your Outlook data from passing over VPN connections (to a central
office) before it goes over the Internet.
* Be sure your mailbox data adheres to the limitations on folder, and
item, amounts.
