== Internet Sites in Microsoft Azure using SharePoint Server 2013

Internet sites that use SharePoint Server 2013 benefit by being hosted
in Azure Infrastructure Services. This article provides resources for
designing and implementing this solution.

=== Using Azure Infrastructure Services for Internet sites

Microsoft Azure provides a compelling option for hosting Internet sites
based on SharePoint Server 2013. Advantages include the following:

* Focus on developing a great site instead of building infrastructure.
* Flexibility to scale your solution based on demand by scaling out and
in.
* Pay only for the resources that you need and use.
* Take advantage of Azure Active Directory for customer accounts.
* Add features that are not currently available in Microsoft 365, such
as deep reporting and analytics.
