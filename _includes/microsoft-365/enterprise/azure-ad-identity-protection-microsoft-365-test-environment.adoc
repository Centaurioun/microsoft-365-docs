== Azure AD Identity Protection for your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

_This Test Lab Guide can only be used for Microsoft 365 for enterprise
test environments._

You can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection to
detect potential vulnerabilities that affect your organization’s
identities, configure automated responses, and investigate incidents.
This article describes how to use Azure AD Identity Protection to view
the analysis of your test environment accounts.

Setting up Azure AD Identity Protection in your Microsoft 365 for
enterprise test environment involves two phases:

Identity Protection]

____

=== Phase 1: Build out your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment

If you want to only test Azure AD Identity Protection in a lightweight
way with the minimum requirements, follow the instructions in
link:lightweight-base-configuration-microsoft-365-enterprise.md[Lightweight
base configuration].

If you want to test Azure AD Identity Protection in a simulated
enterprise, follow the instructions in
link:pass-through-auth-m365-ent-test-environment.md[Pass-through
authentication].

____
[!NOTE] Testing Azure AD Identity Protection doesn’t require the
simulated enterprise test environment, which includes a simulated
intranet connected to the Internet and directory synchronization for an
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest. It is provided here as
an option so that you can test Azure AD Identity Protection and
experiment with it in an environment that represents a typical
organization.
____

=== Phase 2: Use Azure AD Identity Protection

[arabic]
. Open a private instance of your browser and sign in to the Azure
portal at https://portal.azure.com with the global administrator account
of your Microsoft 365 for enterprise test environment.
. In the Azure portal, type *identity protection* in the search box, and
then select *Azure AD Identity Protection*.
. In the *Identity Protection - Overview* blade, select each report to
see what it’s reporting.
. Under *Notify*, select *Users at risk detected alerts*.
. In the *Users at risk detected alerts* pane, select *Medium*.
. For *Emails are sent to the following users*, select *Included* and
verify that your global admin account is in the list of selected
members.
. Select *Save*.

Under *Protect*, select various polices to see how to configure them. If
you create and activate a policy, make sure that it’s not blocking
access for all users, or you might not be able to sign in. To prevent
this, exclude specific user accounts, such as global admins.

For further testing and experimentation, see
link:/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-playbook[Simulating
risk events].
