== Assign admin roles to Microsoft 365 user accounts with PowerShell

_This article applies to both Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise._

You can easily assign roles to user accounts by using PowerShell for Microsoft 365.

____
[!Note] Learn how to  xref:../admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles.adoc[assign admin roles] to user accounts with the Microsoft 365 admin center.

For a list of additional resources, see link:/admin[Manage users and groups].
____

=== Use the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module

First, use a *Azure AD DC admin*, *Cloud Application Admin*, or *Global admin* account to link:connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-azure-active-directory-powershell-for-graph-module[connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant].

For more information, see link:/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?[About admin roles].

Next, identify the sign-in name of the user account that you want to add to a role (example: fredsm\@contoso.com).
This is also known as the user principal name (UPN).

Next, determine the name of the role.
See link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference[Azure AD built-in roles].

____
[!Note] Pay attention to the notes in this article.
Some role names are different for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) PowerShell.
For example, the _SharePoint Administrator_ role in the Microsoft 365 admin center is _SharePoint Service Administrator_ in Azure AD PowerShell.
____

Next, fill in the sign-in and role names and run these commands:

[,powershell]
----
$userName="<sign-in name of the account>"
$roleName="<admin role name>"
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
if ($role -eq $null) {
$roleTemplate = Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleTemplate | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
Enable-AzureADDirectoryRole -RoleTemplateId $roleTemplate.ObjectId
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
}
Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userName}).ObjectID
----

Here's an example of a completed command set that assigns the SharePoint Service Administrator role to the _belindan\@contoso.com_ account:

[,powershell]
----
$userName="belindan@contoso.com"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
if ($role -eq $null) {
$roleTemplate = Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleTemplate | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
Enable-AzureADDirectoryRole -RoleTemplateId $roleTemplate.ObjectId
$role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where {$_.displayName -eq $roleName}
}
Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId -RefObjectId (Get-AzureADUser | Where {$_.UserPrincipalName -eq $userName}).ObjectID
----

To display the list of user names for a specific admin role, use these commands.

[,powershell]
----
$roleName="<role name>"
Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where { $_.DisplayName -eq $roleName } | Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember | Ft DisplayName
----

=== Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, use a global administrator account to link:connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell[connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant].

==== For a single role change

The most common ways to specify the user account is by using its display name or its email name, which also known as its sign-in name or user principal name (UPN).

===== Display names of user accounts

If you're used to working with the display names of user accounts, determine the following information:

* The user account that you want to configure
+
To specify the user account, you must determine its Display Name.
To get a complete list of accounts, use this command:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolUser -All | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName | More
----
+
This command lists the Display Name of your user accounts, sorted by the Display Name, one screen at a time.
You can filter the list to a smaller set by using the *Where* cmdlet.
See the following example.
+
____
[!Note] PowerShell Core doesn't support the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module and cmdlets with _Msol_ in their name.
Run these cmdlets from Windows PowerShell.
____
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -like "John*" | Sort DisplayName | Select DisplayName | More
----
+
This command lists only the user accounts for which the Display Name starts with "John".

* The role you want to assign
+
To display the list of available admin roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
----

After you determine the Display Name of the account and the name of the role, use these commands to assign the role to the account:

[,powershell]
----
$dispName="<The Display Name of the account>"
$roleName="<The admin role name you want to assign to the account>"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -eq $dispName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $roleName
----

Paste the commands into Notepad.
For the _$dispName_ and _$roleName_ variables, replace the description text with their values.
Remove the < and > characters but keep the quotation marks.
Paste the modified lines into the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell window to run them.
Alternately, you can use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Script Environment (ISE).

Here's an example of a completed command set:

[,powershell]
----
$dispName="Scott Wallace"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -eq $dispName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $roleName
----

===== Sign-in names of user accounts

If you're used to working with the sign-in names or UPNs of user accounts, determine the following information:

* The user account's UPN
+
If you don't know the UPN, use this command:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolUser -All | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
----
+
This command lists the UPN of your user accounts, sorted by UPN, one screen at a time.
You can use the *Where* cmdlet to filter the list.
Here's an example:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolUser -All | Where DisplayName -like "John*" | Sort UserPrincipalName | Select UserPrincipalName | More
----
+
This command lists only the user accounts for which the Display Name starts with "John".

* The role you want to assign
+
To display the list of available roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
----

After you have the UPN of the account and the name of the role, use these commands to assign the role to the account:

[,powershell]
----
$upnName="<The UPN of the account>"
$roleName="<The role name you want to assign to the account>"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $upnName -RoleName $roleName
----

Copy the commands and paste them into Notepad.
For the *$upnName* and *$roleName* variables.
Replace the description text with their values.
Remove the < and > characters but keep the quotation marks.
Paste the modified lines into Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell window to run them.
Alternately, you can use the Windows PowerShell ISE.

Here's an example of a completed command set:

[,powershell]
----
$upnName="scottw@contoso.com"
$roleName="SharePoint Service Administrator"
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $upnName -RoleName $roleName
----

==== Multiple role changes

For multiple role changes, determine the following information:

* Which user accounts you want to configure.
You can use the methods in the previous section to gather the set of display names or UPNs.
* Which roles you want to assign to each user account.
To display the list of available roles that you can assign to user accounts, use this command:
+
[,powershell]
----
Get-MsolRole | Sort Name | Select Name,Description
----

Next, create a comma-separated value (CSV) text file that has the display name or UPN and role name fields.
You can do this easily in Microsoft Excel.

Here's an example for display names:

[,powershell]
----
DisplayName,RoleName
"Belinda Newman","Billing Administrator"
"Scott Wallace","SharePoint Service Administrator"
----

Next, fill in the location of the CSV file and run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.

[,powershell]
----
$fileName="<path and file name of the input CSV file that has the role changes, example: C:\admin\RoleUpdates.CSV>"
$roleChanges=Import-Csv $fileName | ForEach {Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress (Get-MsolUser | Where DisplayName -eq $_.DisplayName).UserPrincipalName -RoleName $_.RoleName }
----

Here's an example for UPNs:

[,powershell]
----
UserPrincipalName,RoleName
"belindan@contoso.com","Billing Administrator"
"scottw@contoso.com","SharePoint Service Administrator"
----

Next, fill in the location of the CSV file and run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.

[,powershell]
----
$fileName="<path and file name of the input CSV file that has the role changes, example: C:\admin\RoleUpdates.CSV>"
$roleChanges=Import-Csv $fileName | ForEach { Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleMemberEmailAddress $_.UserPrincipalName -RoleName $_.RoleName }
