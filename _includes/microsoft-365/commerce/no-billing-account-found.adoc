== No billing account found for buying products

If you recently became a Global admin for your organization but aren’t
able to buy or edit anything in the Billing pages of the Microsoft 365
admin center, you might be missing the Billing account owner role needed
to do those tasks. For example, if you try to buy a new subscription on
the *Purchase services* page, you might see a notification that says,
``You don’t have any billing accounts for buying products.'' If this
happens, you can give yourself the Billing account owner role needed to
buy and edit products.

If you’re a Billing admin and can’t buy or edit products, or if you’re a
Global Reader who can’t view the billing account, ask your Global admin
to assign you the role you need.

=== Before you begin

You must be a Global admin to do the steps described in this article.
For more information, see
link:../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md[About admin roles].

=== Assign the correct Billing account role to yourself or others

If you’re not the first Global admin on the account, use the following
steps to give yourself the role you need to buy and edit products for
your organization. You can also use these steps to assign the correct
roles to Billing admins and Global readers who need to access the
billing account.
