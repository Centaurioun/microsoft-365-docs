== Enable pay-as-you-go for your subscription

By default, when you buy a subscription that has a calling plan, you’re
limited to the number of minutes included in the plan. After those
minutes are used up, your users can’t make Teams calls until the next
billing period. If you choose to turn on the pay-as-you-go option, your
users can continue to make calls over the number of minutes included in
the plan, referred to as _overage_. Your next invoice shows overage
charges for extra calls at the pay-as-you-go rate.

=== Before you begin

You must be a billing account owner or billing account contributor to
buy a subscription with a calling plan and enable the pay-as-you-go
option. For more information, see
link:../manage-billing-accounts.md[Understand billing accounts].

=== Buy a pay-as-you-go product in the Microsoft 365 admin center and enable overage

If you already have a subscription, you can buy a new plan that has a
calling plan, and then enable the overage option for it.
