== Manage self-service purchases (Admin)

As an admin, you can see self-service purchases made by people in your
organization. You see the product name, purchaser name, subscriptions
purchased, expiration date, purchase price, and assigned users for each
self-service purchase. If required by your organization, you can turn
off self-service purchasing on a per product basis via PowerShell. You
have the same data management and access policies over products bought
through self-service purchase or centrally.

You can also control whether users in your organization can make
self-service purchases. For more information, see
link:allowselfservicepurchase-powershell.md[Use AllowSelfServicePurchase
for the MSCommerce PowerShell module].

=== Disable or enable self-service purchases

You can disable or enable self-service purchases for users in your
organization. The *MSCommerce* PowerShell module includes a *PolicyID*
parameter value for *AllowSelfServicePurchase* that lets you control
whether users in your organization can make self-service purchases, and
for which products.

You can use the *MSCommerce* PowerShell module to:

* View the default state of the *AllowSelfServicePurchase* parameter
value—whether it’s enabled or disabled by product
* View a list of applicable products and whether self-service purchase
is enabled or disabled
* View or modify the current setting for a specific product to either
enable or disable it

____
[!IMPORTANT] When you use the *AllowSelfServicePurchase* policy, it
enables or disables both self-service purchases and self-service trials.
For a list of the products available for self-service purchase, see

subscription.

purchase subscription receives an email that says the subscription was
canceled.
