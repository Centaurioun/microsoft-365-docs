== Change your Microsoft 365 for business billing addresses

Your bill or invoice contains three addresses:

* *Sold-To Address* Your company name and address, as shown in your
organization profile.
* *Bill-To address* The address of your billing department, usually the
same as the *Sold-To* address.
* *Service Usage Address* The address where the service is being used,
usually the same as the *Sold-To* address. If your organization has
remote users or multiple offices, use the address where the majority of
your users are located.

In most cases, these addresses are the same. If you need to change one
or more of the addresses, you can do that. You can also provide an
alternate email address to receive billing notifications and change the
alternate email address for other admins.
