== Deploy Microsoft Whiteboard on Windows 10 devices

Whiteboard can be deployed on devices that run Windows 10 or later using
Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Configuration Manager (formerly System
Center Configuration Manager). Whiteboard isn’t supported on Windows
Server.

In order to deploy Whiteboard, you must first ensure that Whiteboard is
enabled for your organization. For more information, see
link:manage-whiteboard-access-organizations.md[Manage access to
Whiteboard].

* *Microsoft Intune using an online license mode* – This process allows
you to specify groups of users who will receive access to the Whiteboard
app.
* *Microsoft Configuration Manager using manual offline installation and
updates* – This process allows you to install Whiteboard and then
manually update it every 2–4 weeks.

____
[!NOTE] We recommend using Microsoft Intune. Using Microsoft
Configuration Manager requires IT to continuously repackage and install
updates to ensure users are running an up-to-date version.
