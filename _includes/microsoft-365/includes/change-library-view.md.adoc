There are multiple ways to view how you see the information in a SharePoint document library.
You can change the view in your document library to fit your needs or preferences.

To change the view on the library page, select the view dropdown menu to show the options, and then select the view you want to use.

For example, if you select *Tiles* from the list, the page will display as shown.

The *Tiles* view displays up to eight user-created fields.
If there are fewer than eight, up to four system-generated fields are shown: Sensitivity (if available), Retention (if available), Content type, Modified date, Modified by, and Classification date.

To edit any current view, on the view dropdown menu, select *Edit current view*.
