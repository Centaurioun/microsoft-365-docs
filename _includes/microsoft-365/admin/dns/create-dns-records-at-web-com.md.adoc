== Connect your DNS records at web.com to Microsoft 365

*link:../setup/domains-faq.yml[Check the Domains FAQ]* if you don't find what you're looking for.

If web.com is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.

After you add these records at web.com, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.

____
[!NOTE] Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect.
However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system.
If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see xref:../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.adoc[Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records].
____

=== Change your domain's nameserver (NS) records

____
[!IMPORTANT] You must perform this procedure at the domain registrar where you purchased and registered your domain.
____

When you signed up for web.com, you added a domain by using the web.com *Setup* process.

To verify and create DNS records for your domain in Microsoft, you first need to change the nameservers at your domain registrar so that they use the web.com nameservers.

To change your domain's name servers at your domain registrar's website yourself, follow these steps.

. Find the area on the domain registrar's website where you can edit the nameservers for your domain.
. Either create two nameserver records by using the values in the following table, or edit the existing nameserver records so that they match these values.
+
|===
| Type | Value

| First nameserver
| Use the nameserver value provided by web.com.

| Second nameserver
| Use the nameserver value provided by web.com.
|===
+
____
[!TIP] You should use at least two name server records.
If there are any other name servers listed, you should delete them.
____

. Save your changes.

____
[!NOTE] Your nameserver record updates may take up to several hours to update across the Internet's DNS system.
Then your Microsoft email and other services will be all set to work with your domain.
____

=== Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it.
Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

____
[!NOTE] This record is used only to verify that you own your domain;
it doesn't affect anything else.
You can delete it later, if you like.
____

. To get started, go to your domains page at web.com by using https://checkout.web.com/manage-it/index.jsp[this link].
Log in first.
. On the landing page, select *Domain Names*.

| 1 Hour
|===

. Select *ADD*.
+
Wait a few minutes before you verify your new TXT record, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.

Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request the record.
When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in Microsoft 365:

. In the admin center, go to the *Settings* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818[*Domains*].
. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select *Start setup*.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

. Select *Continue*.

=== Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

____
[!IMPORTANT] You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain.

If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsoft.
Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a _single_ SPF record that includes both sets of values.
