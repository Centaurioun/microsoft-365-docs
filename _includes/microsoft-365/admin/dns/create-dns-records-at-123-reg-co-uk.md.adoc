== Connect your DNS records at 123-reg.co.uk to Microsoft 365

*link:../setup/domains-faq.yml[Check the Domains FAQ]* if you don't find what you're looking for.

If 123-reg.co.uk is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.

After you add these records at 123-reg.co.uk, your domain will be set up to work with Microsoft services.

____
[!NOTE] Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect.
However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system.
If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see xref:../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.adoc[Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records].
____

=== Add a TXT record for verification

Before you use your domain with Microsoft, we have to make sure that you own it.
Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain.

____
[!NOTE] This record is used only to verify that you own your domain;
it doesn't affect anything else.
You can delete it later, if you like.
____

. To get started, go to your domains page at 123-reg.co.uk by using https://www.123-reg.co.uk/secure/cpanel/domain/overview[this link].
You'll be prompted to log in first.
. Select *Domains*, and on the Domain name overview page, select the name of the domain that you want to verify or go to Control panel.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-123reg/123reg-domains-1.png" alt-text="Select the domain you want to verify.":::

. On the Manage domain page, under *Advanced domain settings*, choose *Manage DNS*.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-123reg/123reg-domains-2.png" alt-text="Select Manage DNS from the drop-down list.":::

. On the Manage your DNS page, select the *Advanced DNS* tab.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-123reg/123reg-domains-3.png" alt-text="Select the Advanced DNS tab.":::

. In the *Type* box for the new record choose *TXT/SPF* from the drop-down list, and then type or copy and paste the other values from the following table.
+
|===
| Hostname | Type | Destination TXT/SPF

| @
| TXT/SPF
| MS=ms__XXXXXXXX__ + *Note:* This is an example.
Use your specific *Destination or Points to Address* value here, from the table.

+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-123reg/123reg-domains-TypeTXTSPF.png" alt-text="Select the TXT/SPF type from the drop-down list, and fill in the values.":::

. Select *Add*.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-123reg/123reg-domains-TXTSPF-Add.png" alt-text="Select Add.":::
+
Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.

Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Microsoft and request a search for the record.
When Microsoft finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in Microsoft 365:

. In the admin center, go to the *Settings* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818[*Domains*].
. On the Domains page, select the domain that you're verifying, and select *Start setup*.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/dns-IONOS/IONOS-DomainConnects-2.png" alt-text="Select Start setup.":::

. Select *Continue*.
. On the *Verify domain* page, select *Verify*.

=== Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam

____
[!IMPORTANT] You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain.
If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues.
If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Microsfot.
Instead, add the required Microsoft values to the current record so that you have a _single_ SPF record that includes both sets of values.
Need examples?
Check out these xref:../../enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records.adoc[External Domain Name System records for Microsoft].
To validate your SPF record, you can use one of these link:../setup/domains-faq.yml[SPF validation tools].
