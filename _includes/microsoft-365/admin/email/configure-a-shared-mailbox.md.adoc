== Configure Microsoft 365 shared mailbox settings

After you have xref:create-a-shared-mailbox.adoc[created a shared mailbox], you'll want to configure some settings for the mailbox users, such as email forwarding and automatic replies.
Later, you might want to change other settings, such as the mailbox name, members, or member permissions.

=== Change the name or email alias of a shared mailbox, or change the primary email address

. In the admin center, go to the *Groups* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847[Shared mailboxes] page.
. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, and then select *Edit* next to *Name, Email, Email aliases*.
. Enter a new name, or add another alias.
If you want to change the primary email address, your mailbox must have more than one email alias.
. Select *Save*.

=== Forward emails that are sent to a shared mailbox

You do not need to assign a license to the shared mailbox in order to forward email that's sent to it.
You can forward the messages to any valid email address or distribution list.

. In the admin center, go to the *Groups* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847[Shared mailboxes] page.
. Select the shared mailbox you want to edit, then select *Email forwarding* > *Edit*.
. Set the toggle to *On*, and enter one email address to forward the messages to.
It can be any valid email address.
To forward to multiple addresses, you need to link:/office365/admin/setup/create-distribution-lists[create a distribution group] for the addresses, and then enter the name of the group in this box.

You can't add images, only text.
. If you want to _also_ send a reply to people outside your organization, select the check box, who you want to get the reply, and type the text.
There's no way to only send to people outside your organization but not to people inside your organization.
. Select *Save*.

=== Allow everyone to see the Sent email (the replies)

By default, messages sent from the shared mailbox aren't saved to the Sent Items folder of the shared mailbox.
