== Add a new employee to Microsoft 365

This article helps you onboard a new employee to Microsoft 365 for business.
We assume you're an Admin and you've already xref:../setup/setup.adoc[completed Microsoft 365 set up], and now you have someone new joining your company.

You're in the right place if your new employee needs Microsoft 365, and you're using a https://products.office.com/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans[Microsoft 365 plan] that lets you install Office apps like Word and Excel on a computer.

*Not an admin?* https://support.microsoft.com/office/396b8d9e-e118-42d0-8a0d-87d1f2f055fb[Learn your way around Microsoft 365] helps business and home users with set up.

*No Office apps in your plan?* Follow the steps below, but skip the sections for installing apps.
Use the https://support.microsoft.com/office/91a4ec74-67fe-4a84-a268-f6bdf3da1804[Online versions of Office] instead.

Here's a quick overview:

=== Step 1: Create a Microsoft 365 account for the employee

For instructions, see xref:add-users.adoc[Add users and assign licenses at the same time].
When you set up your new employee, you can choose to send log-in details to the employee's personal account.
This way, they'll receive an email from Microsoft Online Service Team that tells them how to log in to Microsoft 365.

=== Step 2: Give the employee their user ID and password

Unless you sent it to their personal email address, print out the employee's sign in name and password, and hand it to them.
Or tell them the information over the phone.

Because they won't yet have access to their email, don't send the information to that email address.

=== Step 3: Explain where to sign in

Just like Facebook, Amazon, or Gmail, your employee signs in to use Microsoft 365.
Give them the following sign in information:

* Sign in at https://www.office.com.
* Select *Sign in*, then type the user ID and password.

=== Step 4: Help your employee get started

Share with them the xref:../setup/employee-quick-setup.adoc[Employee quick setup for Microsoft 365] to sign in, install software, set up email, and more.
