== Testing the ServiceNow configuration

If your application requires successful communication with external systems, outline how to test the connection to ensure a successful configuration.

Follow these steps to test the configuration of Microsoft 365 support integration:

. Log into your ServiceNow portal as admin.
. Open any incident.
. Focus on the *Microsoft 365 Support* tab and select *Microsoft 365 Insights* to determine if the recommended solutions were returned successfully.
