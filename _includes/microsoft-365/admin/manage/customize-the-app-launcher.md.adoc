== Add custom tiles to the app launcher

In Microsoft 365, you can quickly and easily get to your email, calendars, documents, and apps using the App launcher (https://support.microsoft.com/office/79f12104-6fed-442f-96a0-eb089a3f476a[learn more]).
These are apps you get with Microsoft 365 as well as custom apps that you add from the https://support.microsoft.com/office/dd98e50e-d3db-4ecb-9bb7-82b189822d43[SharePoint Store] or link:/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/[Azure AD].

You can add your own custom tiles to the app launcher that point to SharePoint sites, external sites, legacy apps, and more.
The custom tile appears under the app launcher's *All* apps, but you can pin it to the *Home* apps and instruct your users to do the same.
This makes it easy to find the relevant sites, apps, and resources to do your job.
In the below example, a custom tile called "Contoso Portal" is used to access an organization's SharePoint intranet site.

. Select *Add a custom tile*.
. Enter a *Tile name* for the new tile.

Use HTTPS in the URL.

____
[!TIP] If you're creating a tile for a SharePoint site, navigate to that site, copy the URL, and paste it here.
The URL of your default team site looks like this: `https://<company_name>.sharepoint.com`
____

. Enter a *URL of the image* for the tile.
The image appears on the My apps page and app launcher.
