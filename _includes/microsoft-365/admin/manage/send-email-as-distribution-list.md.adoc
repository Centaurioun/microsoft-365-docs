== Send Microsoft 365 email as a distribution list

In Microsoft 365, you can send email as a distribution list.
When a person who is a member of the distribution list replies to a message sent to the distribution list, the email appears to be from the distribution list, not from the individual user.
This topic shows you how to do this.

=== Before you begin

Before you perform these steps, make sure you've been added to a Microsoft 365 distribution list and you've have been granted Send as permission on it.

*Admins*: Make sure you've followed the steps in the xref:../email/add-user-or-contact-to-distribution-list.adoc[Add a Microsoft 365 user or contact to a list] and link:../../solutions/allow-members-to-send-as-or-send-on-behalf-of-group.md#allow-members-to-send-email-as-a-group[Allow members to send email as a Microsoft 365 Group] topics, and added the correct people to the distribution list.

=== Outlook on the web

. Open Outlook on the web and go to your inbox.
. Open a message that was sent to the distribution list.
. Select *Reply*.
. At the bottom of the message, select *More* > *Show from*.

. Then type the distribution list address such as support@contoso.com, and send the message.
The next time you reply from the distribution list, its address will appear as an option in the *From* list.
