== What is a domain?

*link:../setup/domains-faq.yml[Check the Domains FAQ]* if you don't find what you're looking for.

A domain is a unique name that appears after the *@* sign in email addresses, and after *www.* in web addresses.
It typically takes the form of your organization's name and a standard Internet suffix, such as *yourbusiness.com* or *stateuniversity.edu*.

Using a custom domain like *rob@contoso.com* with Microsoft 365 can help build credibility and recognition for your brand.

=== Choose the experience that's best for you:

*Buy a new domain:*

Use Microsoft 365 to buy a new domain - we'll set everything up.

*Use a domain you already own:*

If you already own a domain like  *you@yourcompany.com* you can add it and start using OneDrive and Microsoft apps right away.
You'll need to take a few minutes to setup mail and Skype for Business.
