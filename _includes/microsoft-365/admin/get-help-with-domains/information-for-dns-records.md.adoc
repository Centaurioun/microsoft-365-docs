==== Step 1: Find the TXT record value and verify

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the *Settings* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818[Domains] page.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

. In the admin center, go to the *Settings* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007048[Domains] page.

::: moniker-end

. On the *Domains* page, select your domain, then select *Start setup*.
You'll go back to the domains setup wizard to see the specific value you need to add.
. On the *Domain Verification* page, select *Add a TXT record to the domain's DNS records*, then select *Continue*.
. Copy the *TXT value* shown.
It looks like this: *MS=msXXXXXXXX*.
. Go to xref:create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider.adoc[Add DNS records to connect your domain], and follow the steps to add records at your DNS host's website.
. Follow the steps for creating the TXT record (or MX record) at your DNS host, then verify the domain back in Microsoft 365.
. Remove the TXT record (or MX record) from your DNS host once the domain is verified in Microsoft 365.
