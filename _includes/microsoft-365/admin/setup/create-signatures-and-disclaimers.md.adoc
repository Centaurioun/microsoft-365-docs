=== Limitations of organization wide signatures

You can't do the following when managing email signatures in Microsoft 365:

* Insert the signature directly under the latest email reply or forward
* Display server-side email signatures in users' Sent Items folders
* Embed images in email signatures
* Skip lines which contain variables that couldn't be updated (e.g.
because the value wasn't provided for a user)

To gain these and other capabilities to manage email signatures, use a third-party tool.
Please do an internet search for *email signature software*.
A number of these providers are Microsoft Gold Partners and their software provides these capabilities.
