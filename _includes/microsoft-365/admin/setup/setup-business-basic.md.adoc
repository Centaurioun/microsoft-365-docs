Go ahead and add licenses to them as well.
. After you've added the users, you'll also get an option to share credentials with the new users you added.
You can choose to print them out, email them, or download them.

To set up services, you have to update some records at your DNS host or domain registrar.

. The setup wizard typically detects your registrar and gives you a link to step-by-step instructions for updating your NS records at the registrar website.
If it doesn't, xref:../get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.adoc[Change nameservers to set up Office 365 with any domain registrar].
 ** If you have existing DNS records, for example an existing web site, but your DNS host is enabled for link:/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/domain-connect[domain connect], choose *Add records for me*.
On the *Choose your online services* page, accept all the defaults, and choose *Next*, and choose *Authorize* on your DNS host's page.
 ** If you have existing DNS records with other DNS hosts (not enabled for domain connect), you'll want to manage your own DNS records to make sure the existing services stay connected.
See link:/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/dns-basics[domain basics] for more info.
. Follow the steps in the wizard and email and other services will be set up for you.

When the signup process is complete, you'll be directed to the admin center, where you can add users, and assign licenses.
After you complete the initial setup, you can use the *Setup* page in the admin center to continue setting up and configuring the services that come with your subscriptions.
