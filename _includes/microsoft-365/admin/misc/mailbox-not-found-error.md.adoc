== Getting a mailbox not found error in Outlook on the web?

If you're using Outlook on the web and you get a  *Mailbox couldn't be found for*  error, the account that you used to connect to Outlook on the web doesn't have an Exchange Online license and therefore, no mailbox is associated with the account.

=== Assign a license to your account

Your admin can assign a license to your account by following these steps:

. Open the  https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/homepage[Microsoft 365 admin center]  and go to  *Active users*  under the  *Users*  section, and select the user who is seeing the error.
. In the user page that opens, go to the  *Licenses and Apps*  section, select the appropriate  *Location*  value, and assign a license that contains Exchange Online (expand the license to see its details).
. When you're finished, click  *Save changes*.
