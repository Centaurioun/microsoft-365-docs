== Azure Active Directory setup guides

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) features help you manage and secure your organization.
These setup guides will help you integrate those features in a simple way.
In the following sections, we'll briefly describe the setup guides and share links to the guides.

=== Who are these setup guides for?

These setup guides are designed for small to medium-sized organizations that typically might not have a dedicated identity team.
You don't need to be an identity expert to use them.

=== What to expect and what you'll need

The setup guides help you configure the core functionality of Azure AD.
If you need to set up a more advanced configuration, the setup guide will point you to the appropriate location in the Azure AD portal.

==== Required permissions

You must be a member of the following administrative roles:

* Global administrator: allows you to use integrated tools in the setup guides to make changes in your Microsoft 365 organization.
* Global reader: allows you to view the setup guides but not make changes in your tenant.

=== Identity security for Teams

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is our cloud-based identity and access management service, which helps your employees sign in and access apps and services.
This catalog contains some basic security features you can use to ensure your users are safe and have the most productive time using Teams.

==== Licensing

An Azure Active Directory P2 license is required to utilize the security features in this catalog.

=== Identity Governance

This wizard catalog is designed to help customers with Azure Active Directory P2 functionality, including Access Reviews (AR), Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Entitlement Management (ELM).
For PIM and ELM we offer a curated list of docs and a pointer to the Azure Active Directory admin center, where the admin can configure this functionality.
For AR, we offer a fully automated experience that allows admins to choose from two templates.
These templates include one that allows group owners to approve guest usage in all Microsoft 365 groups.
This is a top policy that customers use today.

Next, we offer a test template, where the admin is the reviewer of guests for a specific group they choose.
If the tenant already has a review in place that covers all Microsoft 365 groups guest users, the admin will be pointed to the Azure Active Directory admin center to manage the existing review and there will be no automated experience.
