The partner you choose depends on the Microsoft services you use and the country or region where you'll use those services.
If you are adding a partner, or changing the partner for your subscription, first you need to get the partner's Microsoft Partner ID by asking the partner for it.

As an admin for Office 365, you can create or edit users, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, manage domains, and assign admin permissions to other users in your organization, among other things.
However, if you want someone else to do these administrative tasks, you can delegate this role to an authorized partner of 21Vianet by creating a partner relationship.
