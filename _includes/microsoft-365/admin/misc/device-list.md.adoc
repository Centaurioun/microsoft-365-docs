== Windows Autopilot device list CSV-file

=== Device list .csv file format

To manage and deploy devices through Windows Autopilot, you'll need a .csv file that contains specific information about the devices.

Columns in the device list file must have the following headers in the specified order:

* Column A: Device Serial Number
* Column B: leave blank
* Column C: Hardware Hash

You can get this information from your hardware vendor, or you can use the https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo[Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo PowerShell script] that will generate a CSV file.

When you add devices, you also need to add them to a Profile.
A profile is used to apply AutoPilot deployment profiles to a device or a group of devices.
