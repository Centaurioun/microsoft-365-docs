== ICANN verification of contact information

When you purchase a domain or make changes to the contact information for a domain, the registrar is required to validate your contact information to comply with ICANN regulations.

For validation, an email is sent to the registrant's address.

*To verify your contact information, select the link in the verification email.* If the domain owners don't verify the the email address, the domain will be suspended.
Then, go to the https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?ref=Domains[Domains page] in the admin center and check your domain status.

The email will look like this:
