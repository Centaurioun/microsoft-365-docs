== Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams user activity

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization.
It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product.
Check out xref:activity-reports.adoc[the Reports overview topic].
In the Microsoft Teams user activity report, you can gain insights into the Microsoft Teams activity in your organization.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the *Export* link.
This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.
The exported format for *audio time*, *video time*, and *screen share time* follows ISO8601 duration format.

The *Microsoft Teams user activity* report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days.
However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

To ensure data quality, we perform daily data validation checks for the past three days and will be filling any gaps detected.
You may notice differences in historical data during the process.
