== Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Yammer activity report

As Microsoft 365 admin, the Reports dashboard shows you data on the usage of the products within your organization.
Check out xref:activity-reports.adoc[activity reports in the admin center].
With the *Yammer Activity report*, you can understand the level of engagement of your organization with Yammer by looking at the number of unique users using Yammer to post, like or read a message and the amount of activity generated across the organization.

=== How do I get to the Yammer activity report?

. In the admin center, go to the *Reports*, and then select *Usage*.
. From the dashboard homepage, click on the *View more* button on the Yammer card.

You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the *Export* link.
This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.

The *Yammer activity* report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days.
However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).
