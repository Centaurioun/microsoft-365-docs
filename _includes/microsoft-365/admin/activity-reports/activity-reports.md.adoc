== Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center

Check out https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659[Microsoft 365 small business help] on YouTube.

You can easily see how people in your business are using Microsoft 365 services.
For example, you can identify who is using a service a lot and reaching quotas, or who may not need a Microsoft 365 license at all.
Perpetual license model will not be included in the reports.

Reports are available for the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days.
Data won't exist for all reporting periods right away.
The reports become available within 48 hours.

=== How to view licensing information

* To see how many licenses you have assigned and unassigned, in the admin center, go to the *Billing* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264[Licenses] page.
* To see who is licensed, unlicensed, or guest, in the admin center, go to the *Users* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822[Active users] page.

=== How to view usage information for a specific user

Use the service reports to research how much a specific user is using the service.
For example, to find out how much mailbox storage a specific user has consumed, open the Mailbox usage report, and sort the users by name.
If you have thousands of users, export the report to Excel so you filter through the list quickly.

You can't generate a report where you enter a user's account and then get a list of which services they are using and how much.

There are circumstances where new users show up as *unknown*.
This is usually due to occasional delays in creating user profiles.

=== Show user details in the reports

By default, user details will be hidden for all reports.

Your user list will look like this:

image::../../media/2ed99bce-4978-4ee3-9ea2-4a8db26eef02.png[Reports - anonymized user list.]

If you want to unhide user-level information when you're generating your reports, a *global administrator* can quickly make that change in the admin center.

Reports provide information about your organization's usage data.
By default, reports display information with identifiable names for users, groups, and sites.
Starting September 1, 2021, we are hiding user information by default for all reports as part of our ongoing commitment to help companies support their local privacy laws.

Global administrators can revert this change for their tenant and show identifiable user information if their organization's privacy practices allow it.
It can be achieved in the Microsoft 365 admin center by following these steps:

. In the admin center, go to the *Settings* > *Org Settings* > *Services* page.
. Select *Reports*.
. Uncheck the statement *Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports*, and then save your changes.

Beginning on June 23, 2022, an API will gradually become available to all environments for global admins to change this setting without needing to visit the Microsoft 365 admin center.
The API details are below:

The URL is https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/reportSettings

Two methods have been approved for this API:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/api-show-details.png" alt-text="API Methods.":::

The report will only contain a Privacy Setting property.
For more information on Graph API, see link:/graph/use-the-api[Use the Microsoft Graph API].
Global admins can use the Software Development Kit (SDK) or directly call the API using any program language with network ability.
We recommend using link:/graph/graph-explorer/graph-explorer-overview[Graph Explorer].

It'll take a few minutes for these changes to take effect on the reports in the reports dashboard.
This setting also applies to the Microsoft 365 usage reports in link:/graph/api/resources/report[Microsoft Graph] and link:/microsoft-365/admin/usage-analytics/usage-analytics[Power BI] and link:/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/teams-reporting-reference[the usage reports in Microsoft Teams Admin center].
Showing identifiable user information is a logged event in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal audit log.

=== What happens to usage data when a user account is closed?

Whenever you close a user's account, Microsoft will delete that user's usage data within 30 days.
That user will still be included in the Activity chart totals for the periods she was active in, but will not appear in the User Details table.

However, when you select a particular day, up to 28 days from the current date, the report show the user's usage for that day in the User Details table.
