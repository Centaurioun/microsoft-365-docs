== Restore a deleted Microsoft 365 group

If you've deleted a group, it will be retained for 30 days by default.
This 30-day period is considered a "soft-delete" because you can still restore the group.
After 30 days, the group and its associated contents are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.

When a group is restored, the following content is restored:

* Azure Active Directory (AD) Microsoft 365 Groups object, properties, and members.
* Group's e-mail addresses.
* Exchange Online shared Inbox and calendar.
* SharePoint Online team site and files.
* OneNote notebook
* Planner
* Teams
* Yammer group and group content (If the Microsoft 365 group was created from Yammer)
* Power BI link:/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-workspaces[Classic workspace]

____
[!NOTE] This article describes restoring only Microsoft 365 groups.
All other groups cannot be restored once deleted.
