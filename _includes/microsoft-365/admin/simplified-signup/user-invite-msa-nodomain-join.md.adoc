=== Frequently asked questions

==== The webpage is asking me to agree that my business has access to my name, sign-in and other information -- what does that mean?

You own your documents and chats.

However, as part of setting up Microsoft 365 business, you are consenting that your technical admin will have access to a limited amount of account information, specifically, your account information, such as your name, profile picture, email address, and your sign-in details and activity.
