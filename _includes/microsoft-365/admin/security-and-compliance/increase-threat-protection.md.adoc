== Increase threat protection for Microsoft 365 for business

Check out https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197659[Microsoft 365 small business help] on YouTube.

This article helps you increase the protection in your Microsoft 365 subscription to protect against phishing, malware, and other threats.
These recommendations are appropriate for organizations with an increased need for security, like law offices and health care clinics.

Before you begin, check your Office 365 Secure Score.
Office 365 Secure Score analyzes your organization's security based on your regular activities and security settings, and assigns a score.
Begin by taking note of your current score.
To increase your score, complete the actions recommended in this article.
The goal isn't to achieve the maximum score, but to be aware of opportunities to protect your environment that don't negatively affect productivity for your users.

For more information, see xref:../../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.adoc[Microsoft Secure Score].

=== Watch: Raise the level of protection against malware in mail

Your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 environment includes protection against malware.
You can increase this protection by blocking attachments with file types that are commonly used for malware.

____

. From the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339[Microsoft 365 admin center], choose *Show more*, *Admin centers*, and then *Security*.
. Go to *Email & collaboration* > *Policies & rules* > *Threat policies*.
. From the policies available, choose *Anti-malware*.

To increase malware protection in email:

. In the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender portal], go to *Email & collaboration* > *Policies & rules* > *Threat policies* > *Anti-malware* in the *Policies* section.
. On the *Anti-malware* page, double-click on *Default (Default)*.
A flyout appears.
. Select *Edit protection settings* at the bottom of the flyout.
. under *Protection settings*, select the checkbox next to *Enable the common attachments filter*.
The file types that are blocked are listed directly below this control.
Make sure that you add these file types:
+
`ade, adp, ani, bas, bat, chm, cmd, com, cpl, crt, hlp, ht, hta, inf, ins, isp, job, js, jse, lnk, mda, mdb, mde, mdz, msc, msi, msp, mst, pcd, reg, scr, sct, shs, url, vb, vbe, vbs, wsc, wsf, wsh, exe, pif`

=== Watch: Protect against ransomware

Check out this video and others on our https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2198018[YouTube channel].

Ransomware restricts access to data by encrypting files or locking computer screens.
It then attempts to extort money from victims by asking for "ransom," usually in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, in exchange for access to data.

To protect against ransomware, create one or more mail flow rules to block file extensions that are commonly used for ransomware.
(You added these rules in the <<watch-raise-the-level-of-protection-against-malware-in-mail,Watch: Raise the level of protection against malware in mail>> step.) You can also warn users who receive these attachments in email.

In addition to the files that you blocked in the previous step, it's a good practice to create a rule to warn users before opening Office file attachments that include macros.
Ransomware can be hidden inside macros, so warn users not to open these files from people they don't know.

=== Stop auto-forwarding for email

Hackers who gain access to a user's mailbox can steal mail by setting the mailbox to automatically forward email.
This can happen even without the user's awareness.
To prevent this from happening, configure a mail flow rule.

. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select *Admin centers* > *Exchange*.
. In the *mail flow* category, select *rules*.
. Select *+*, and then select *Create a new rule*.

=== Watch: Protect your email from phishing attacks

Check out this video and others on our https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2198014[YouTube channel].

If you've configured one or more custom domains for your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 environment, you can configure targeted anti-phishing protection.
Anti-phishing protection, part of Microsoft Defender for Office 365, can help protect your organization from malicious impersonation-based phishing attacks and other phishing attacks.
If you haven't configured a custom domain, you don't need to do this.

We recommend that you get started with this protection by creating a policy to protect your most important users and your custom domain.

=== Watch: Protect against malicious attachments and files with Safe Attachments

Check out this video and others on our https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2198019[YouTube channel].

People regularly send, receive, and share attachments, such as documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and more.
It's not always easy to tell whether an attachment is safe or malicious just by looking at an email message.
Microsoft Defender for Office 365, formerly called Microsoft 365 ATP, or Advanced Threat Protection, includes Safe Attachment protection, but this protection is not turned on by default.
We recommend that you create a new rule to begin using this protection.
This protection extends to files in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

Your ATP safe attachments rule has been updated.
Now that protection is in place, you won't be able to open a malicious file from Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, or Teams.
Affected files will have red shields next to them.
If someone attempts to open a blocked file, they'll receive a warning message.

After your policy has been in place for a while, visit the Reports page to see what has been scanned.
