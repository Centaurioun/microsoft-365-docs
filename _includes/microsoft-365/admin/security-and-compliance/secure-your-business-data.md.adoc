| Step | Task | Description

| 1
| *xref:multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.adoc[Use multi-factor authentication]*.
| xref:multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.adoc[Multi-factor authentication] (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data.
Using MFA can prevent hackers from taking over if they know your password.
+  + See xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-conditional-access.adoc[security defaults and MFA].

| 2
| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.adoc[Protect your administrator accounts]*.
| Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks.
You'll need to set up and manage the right number of admin and user accounts for your business.
We also recommend adhering to the information security principle of least privilege, which means that users and applications should be granted access only to the data and operations they require to perform their jobs.
+  + See xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.adoc[Protect your administrator accounts].

| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.adoc[Use preset security policies]*.

| 5
| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.adoc[Train everyone on email best practices]*.
| Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications.
Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications.
Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email.

| 6
| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.adoc[Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing]*.
| The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams.
With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it.

| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.adoc[Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders]*.
| Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use.
We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business.
Grant people only the access they need to do their jobs.

| Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps (also referred to as Office apps) enable people to work productively and more securely across devices.
Whether you're using the web or desktop version of an app, you can start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device.
Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to documents that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive.

| *xref:../../business-premium/m365bp-maintain-environment.adoc[Maintain your environment]*.
| After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan.
As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings.
You'll also want to make sure people have only the access they need to do their jobs.
