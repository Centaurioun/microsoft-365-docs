== Step 4: The tasks tab

On the tasks tab, you’re expected to provide the paths to your test
scripts that are in the zip folder you uploaded under the binaries tab.

* *Out of Box Test Scripts:* Type in the relative paths to your install,
launch, close and uninstall scripts. You also can select extra settings
for the install script.
* *Functional Test Scripts:* Type in the relative path to each
functional test script uploaded. Extra functional test scripts can be
added using the `Add Script` button. You need a minimum of one (1)
script and can add up to eight (8) functional test scripts.
+
The scripts run in the sequence they’re listed. A failure in a
particular script stops subsequent scripts from executing. You also have
the option of selecting extra settings for each script provided.

=== Set script path

Sample of how to provide the relative path on a folder structure is
below:

*_Zip_file_uploaded_* ~~~ ├── file1.exe

├── ScriptX.ps1

├── folder1

│ ├── file3.exe

│ ├── script.ps1 ~~~ - *ScriptX.ps1* would have. _ScriptX.ps1_ as the
relative path. - *Script.ps1* would have _folder1/script.ps1_ as the
relative path.
