== Viewing Test Results

Logging into the Azure portal, you can see application test results at
scheduled intervals against selected updates from the Overview page of
your Test Base account. +
Clicking your Test Base account name, and then clicking links under the
Insights category in the left-hand sector of the page, as follows:

* Test Summary — general overview of test results and status
* Security Update Results — overview and details of security
update-related application test results
* Feature Update Results — overview and details of feature
update-related application test results

From the latter two pages, you’ll have detailed views of test results
that focus on the following areas:

* Script executions
* Reliability data
* Memory utilization
* CPU utilization

The sections that follow describe how to access and review the results
of the previously specified testing areas.
