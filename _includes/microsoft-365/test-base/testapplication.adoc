==== Step 2. Configure test

[arabic]
. Select the *Type of test*. There are two test types supported:
* An *Out of Box (OOB) test* performs an install, launch, close, and
uninstall of your package. After the install, the launch-close routine
is repeated 30 times before a single uninstall is run. The OOB test
provides you with standardized telemetry on your package to compare
across Windows builds.
* A *Functional test* would execute your uploaded test script(s) on your
package. The scripts are run in the sequence you specified and a failure
in a particular script will stop subsequent scripts from executing.

____
[!NOTE] Out of Box test is optional now.

against the B release of Windows monthly quality updates of selected
product(s).
** For customers who have Default Access customers on Test Base, their
applications are validated against the final release version of the B
release security updates, starting from Patch Tuesday.
** For customers who have Full Access customers on Test Base, their
applications are validated against the pre-release versions of the B
release security updates, starting up to 3-weeks before prior to Patch
Tuesday. This allows time for the Full Access customers time to take
proactive steps in resolving any issues found during testing before in
advance of the final release on Patch Tuesday. +
