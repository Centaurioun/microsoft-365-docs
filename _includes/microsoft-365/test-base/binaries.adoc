== Step 3: Upload your binaries, dependencies, and scripts

On this tab, youâ€™ll upload a single zip package containing your
binaries, dependencies and scripts used to run your test suite.

____
[!NOTE] The size of the zip package should be between a minimum of 10 MB
and a maximum of 2 GB.

* Uploaded dependencies can include test frameworks, scripting engines
or data that will be accessed to run your application or test cases. For
example, you can upload Selenium and a web driver installer to help run
browser-based tests.
* Itâ€™s best practice to ensure your script activities are kept modular
that is.
** The `Install` script only performs install operations.
** The `Launch` script only launches the application.
** The `Close` script only closes the application.
** The optional `Uninstall` script only uninstalls the application.

*Currently, the portal only supports PowerShell scripts.*
