* Uploaded dependencies can include test frameworks, scripting engines or data that will be accessed to run your application or test cases.
For example, you can upload Selenium and a web driver installer to help run browser-based tests.
* It's best practice to ensure your script activities are kept modular that is.
 ** The `Install` script only performs install operations.

 ** The `Close` script only closes the application.
 ** The optional `Uninstall` script only uninstalls the application.

*Currently, the portal only supports PowerShell scripts.*
