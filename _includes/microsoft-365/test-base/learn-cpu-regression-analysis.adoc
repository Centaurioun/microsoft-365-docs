== Understanding CPU Regression Analysis

After uploading your applicationâ€™s binaries along with associated test
scripts, the Test Base service will then run the test scripts, and
automatically perform CPU and Memory regression analysis. The service
will then check if the CPU utilization for the application on the
pre-release version of the update for the target OS is in line with the
CPU utilization for the released version of the OS.

CPU utilization is not likely to be a direct comparative match by
operating system, given there can be differences for processes that are
running on two different operating system versions. However, in these
cases, the *Test Base* service analysis should be able to demonstrate
whether CPU utilization for your application is impacted by an upcoming
operating system update and specifically which processes have regressed
from previous test runs.

In the figure that follows, there are two OS release versions against
which CPU utilizations are compared for the same application. The list
of processes should expose any significant regressions. The graphs show
CPU % utilization over time along with the average % utilization per
operating system version release.

____
[!NOTE] Memory or CPU utilization might also improve as a result of an
operating system update, rather than simply deteriorate.
