to support intunewin format for IT Pros who manages apps for their apps
within Intune as the standard onboarding package format. The intunewin
upload flow provides the experience for IT Pros to reuse their intunewin
format packages, which contain the apps they deployed to their end
devices via MEM/Intune to onboarding their apps and test configurations
quickly to Test Base.

*Prerequisites* - Currently Test Base support synchronizing via the same
subscription between Intune account and Test Base account (you don’t
have to have an Intune account to upload your intunewin package however
if you’d like to synchronize the Intune configuration for the intunewin
file’s corresponding apps from Intune, you’ll need to make sure your
Intune account is created under the same subscription as your Test Base
account). - Intunewin packages to be uploaded.

*Intunwin file Upload Flow (synchronized with Intune account)* As an
Intune customer who has an Intune package, which has been already
onboarded to Intune portal. Customer can onboard the intunewin package
(containing an app with/without dependencies of pre-install apps managed
in Intune) to Test Base service. (via Intune account, which has proper
permission to sync the Intune app info).
