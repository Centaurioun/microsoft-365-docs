=== Intunewin Upload Flow

As an effort to further enable commercial utilization, Test Base started to support intunewin format for IT Pros who manages apps for their apps within Intune as the standard onboarding package format.
The intunewin upload flow provides the experience for IT Pros to reuse their intunewin format packages, which contain the apps they deployed to their end devices via MEM/Intune to onboarding their apps and test configurations quickly to Test Base.

*Prerequisites*

* Currently Test Base support synchronizing via the same subscription between Intune account and Test Base account (you don't have to have an Intune account to upload your intunewin package however if you'd like to synchronize the Intune configuration for the intunewin file's corresponding apps from Intune, you'll need to make sure your Intune account is created under the same subscription as your Test Base account).
* Intunewin packages to be uploaded.

*Intunwin file Upload Flow (synchronized with Intune account)* + As an Intune customer who has an Intune package, which has been already onboarded to Intune portal.
Customer can onboard the intunewin package (containing an app with/without dependencies of pre-install apps managed in Intune) to Test Base service.
(via Intune account, which has proper permission to sync the Intune app info).
