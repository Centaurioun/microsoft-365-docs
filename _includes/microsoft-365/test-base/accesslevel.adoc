== Request to change access level

We’re now making access to pre-release Windows update content more
available. Once your request for access to pre-release updates is
approved, your uploaded packages will automatically get scheduled to be
tested against the pre-release Windows updates for the OS versions
selected during onboarding.

To request access, select the ``Access level change request'' option in
the left navigation bar and fill out all the details for your
organization and submit the request. You’ll be notified on the
registered email address once your request is approved. Once approved,
when a new pre-release build is available, your packages will
automatically get tested against the new update for the versions
selected.
