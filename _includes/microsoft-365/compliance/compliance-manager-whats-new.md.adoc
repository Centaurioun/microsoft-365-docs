==== Continuous compliance assessment of improvement actions

We're adding automated testing and evidence generation for over 35 improvement actions in Compliance Manager that were not previously covered by Secure Score.
With continuous compliance assessment, you can receive updates about which of these improvement actions you've completed if they're relevant for your compliance assessments and you're licensed to access the relevant solutions.
Continuous compliance assessment also gives users visibility into the scoring logic of your improvement actions and provides insight and evidence about why you received a certain score.
This feature works alongside existing integrations with Microsoft 365 Secure Score, and any automated actions you've previously configured will continue to work as-is.
Learn more about link:compliance-manager-setup.md#set-up-automated-testing[automated testing settings].

=== February 2022

==== Alerts and alert policies

Users can now set alerts for changes in Compliance Manager that an organization wants to track.
Using an easy setup wizard, you can build alert policies to create notifications when the following types of events happen: an improvement action score change, an improvement action assignment change, a testing or implementation status change in an improvement action, and a file upload or deletion in an improvement action's Documents tab.
Learn more by visiting xref:compliance-manager-alert-policies.adoc[Compliance Manager alerts and alert policies].

Your organization can now get recommendations from Compliance Manager about which assessments may be most relevant to you, with a quick setup process to get up and running.
