== Close, reopen, and delete a eDiscovery (Standard) case

This article describes how to close, reopen, and delete Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) cases in Microsoft 365.

=== Close a case

When the legal case or investigation supported by a eDiscovery (Standard) case is completed, you can close the case.
Here's what happens when you close a case:

* If the case contains any eDiscovery holds, they will be turned off.
After the hold is turned off, a 30-day grace period (called a _delay hold_) is applied to content locations that were on hold.
This helps prevent content from being immediately deleted and provides admins the opportunity to search for and restore content before it may be permanently deleted after the delay hold period expires.
For more information, see link:create-ediscovery-holds.md#removing-content-locations-from-an-ediscovery-hold[Removing content locations from an eDiscovery hold].
* Closing a case only turns off the holds that are associated with that case.
If other holds are placed on a content location (such as a Litigation Hold, a retention policy, or a hold from a different eDiscovery (Standard) case) those holds will still be maintained.
* The case is still listed on the eDiscovery (Standard) page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
The details, holds, searches, and members of a closed case are retained.
* You can edit a case after it's closed.
For example, you can add or remove members, create searches, and export search results.
The primary difference between active and closed cases is that eDiscovery holds are turned off when a case is closed.

To close a case:

. In the compliance portal, click *eDiscovery* > *eDiscovery (Standard)* to display the list of eDiscovery (Standard) cases in your organization.
. Click the name of the case that you want to close.

. On the home page, under *Status*, click *Close case*.
+
A warning is displayed saying that the holds associated with the case will be turned off.

. Click *Yes* to close the case.
+
The status on the case home page is changed from *Active* to *Closing*.

. On the *eDiscovery (Standard)* page, click *Refresh* to update the status of the closed case.
It might take up to 60 minutes for the closing process to complete.
+
When the process is complete, the status of the case is changed to *Closed* on the *eDiscovery (Standard)* page.

=== Reopen a closed case

When you reopen a case, any eDiscovery holds that were in place when the case was closed won't be automatically reinstated.
After the case is reopened, you'll have to go to the *Holds* page and turn on the previous holds.
To turn on a hold, select it to display the flyout page, and then set the *Status* toggle to *On*.

. In the compliance portal, click *eDiscovery* > *Core* to display the list of eDiscovery (Standard) cases in your organization.
. Click the name of the case that you want to reopen.
+

. On the home page, under *Status*, click *Reopen case*.
+
A warning is displayed saying that the holds that were associated with the case when it was closed won't be turned on automatically.

. Click *Yes* to reopen the case.
+
The status on the case home page flyout page is changed from *Closed* to *Active*.

. On the *eDiscovery (Standard)* page, click *Refresh* to update the status of the reopened case.
It might take up to 60 minutes for the reopening process to complete.
+
When the process is complete, the status of the case is changed to *Active* on the *eDiscovery (Standard)* page.

. (Optional) To turn on any holds associated with the reopened case, go to *Holds* tab, select a hold, and then select the checkbox under *Status* on the hold flyout page.

=== Delete a case

You can also delete active and closed eDiscovery (Standard) cases.
When you delete a case, all searches and exports in the case are deleted, and the case is removed from the list of cases on the *eDiscovery (Standard)* page in the compliance portal.
You can't reopen a deleted case.

Before you can delete a case (whether it's active or closed), you must first delete _all_ eDiscovery holds associated with the case.
That includes deleting holds with a status of *Off*.

To delete an eDiscovery hold:

. Go to the *Holds* tab in the case that you want to delete.
. Select the hold that you want to delete.
. On the flyout page, click *Delete*.

To delete a case:

. In the compliance portal, click *eDiscovery* > *eDiscovery (Standard)* to display the list of eDiscovery (Standard) cases in your organization.
. Click the name of the case that you want to delete.
. On the case home page, under *Status*, click *Delete case*.

If the case you're trying to delete still contains eDiscovery holds, you'll receive an error message.
You'll have to delete all holds associated with the case and then try again to delete the case.
