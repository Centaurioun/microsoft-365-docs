____

This article describes how you can manage the lifecycle of documents that are stored in SharePoint by using automatically applied retention labels and event-based retention.

The auto-apply functionality uses SharePoint metadata for document classification.
The example in this article is for product-related documents, but the same concepts can be used for other scenarios.
For example, in the oil and gas industry, you could use it to manage the lifecycle of documents about physical assets such as oil platforms, well logs, or production licenses.
In the financial services industry, you could manage bank account, mortgage, or insurance contract documents.
In the public sector, you could manage construction permits or tax forms.

In this article, we'll look at the information architecture and definition of the retention labels.
Then we'll classify documents by auto-applying the labels.
And finally we'll generate the events that initiate the retention period.

=== Information architecture

Our scenario is a manufacturing company that uses SharePoint to store all the documents about the products that the company develops.
These documents include product specifications, agreements with suppliers, and user manuals.
When these documents are stored in SharePoint through Enterprise Content Management policies, document metadata is defined, which is used to classify them.
Each document has the following metadata properties:

* *Doc Type* (such as product specification, agreement, or user manual)
* *Product Name*
* *Status* (draft or final)

This metadata forms a base content type called _Production Document_ for all the documents.

image::../media/SPRetention1.png[Table of product documentation meta data.]

____
[!NOTE] The *Doc Type* and *Status* properties are used by retention policies later in this scenario to classify and auto-apply retention labels.
____

We might have several content types that represent different types of documents, but let's focus on the product documentation.

In this scenario, we use the Managed Metadata service and the Term Store to create a term set for _Doc Type_ and another one for _Product Name_.
For each term set, we create a term for each value.
It would look like something like this in Term Store for your SharePoint organization:

image::../media/SPRetention2.png[Sample term set for product documentation in Term Store.]

_Content Type_ can be created and published by using the https://support.office.com/article/manage-content-type-publishing-06f39ac0-5576-4b68-abbc-82b68334889b[Content Type Hub].
You can also create and publish a content type by using site provisioning tools, such as the link:/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-framework[PnP provisioning framework] or link:/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-design-json-schema#define-a-new-content-type[site design JSON schema].

Each product has a dedicated SharePoint site that contains one document library that has the right content types enabled.
All documents are stored in this document library.

link:../media/SPRetention3.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention3.png[Document library for product documentation.\]]

____
[!NOTE] Instead of having a SharePoint site per product, the manufacturing company in this scenario could use a Microsoft Team per product to support collaboration among members of the team, such as through persistent chat, and use the *Files* tab in Teams for document management.
In this article we only focus on documents, so, we'll only use a site.
____

Here's a view of the document library for the Spinning Widget product:

link:../media/SPRetention4.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention4.png[Spinning Widget document library.\]]

Now that we have the basic information architecture in place for document management, let's look at the retention and disposal strategy for the documents that use the metadata and how we classify those documents.

=== Retention and disposition

The manufacturing company's compliance and data governance policies dictate how data is preserved and disposed of.
Product-related documents must be kept for as long as the product is manufactured and for a certain additional period.
The additional period differs for product specifications, agreements, and user manuals.
The following table indicates the retention and disposition requirements:

|===
| Document type | Retention | Disposition

| Product specifications
| 5 years after production stops
| Delete

| Product agreements
| 10 years after production stops
| Review

| User manuals
| 5 years after production stops
| Delete

| All other types of documents
| Don't actively retain
| Delete when document is older than 3 years +  + A document is considered older than 3 years if it hasn't been modified within the last 3 years.

|
|
|
|===

We use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to create the following link:retention.md#retention-labels[retention labels]:

* Product Specification
* Product Agreement
* User Manual

In this article, we only show how to create and auto-apply the Product Specification retention label.
To implement the complete scenario, you would also create and auto-apply retention labels for the other two document types.

==== Settings for the Product Specification retention label

Here's the xref:file-plan-manager.adoc[file plan] for the Product Specification retention label:

* *Name:* Product Specification
* *Description for users:* Retain for 5 years after production stops.
* *Description for admins:* Retain for 5 years after production stops, auto delete, event-based retention, event type is _Product Cessation_.
* *Retention action:* Retain and delete.
* *Retention duration:* 5 years (1,825 days).
* *Record label*: Configure the retention label to mark items as a link:records-management.md#records[record], which means the labeled documents can't then be modified or deleted by users.
* *File plan descriptors:* For simplifying the scenario, no optional file descriptors are provided.

The following screenshot shows the settings when you create the Product Specification retention label in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
You can create the _Product Cessation_ event type when you create the retention label.
See the procedure in the following section.

image::../media/SPRetention5.png[Retention settings for the Product Specification label.]

____
[!NOTE] To avoid a 5-year wait for document deletion, set the retention duration to *_1 day_* if you're recreating this scenario in a test environment.
____

==== Create an event type when you create a retention label

. On the *Define retention settings* page of the Create retention label wizard, after *Start the retention period based on*, select *Create new event type*:
+
image::../media/SPRetention6.png[Create a new event type for the Product Specification label dialog box.]

. On the *Name your event type* page, enter *Product Cessation* and an optional description.
Then select *Next*, *Submit*, and *Done*.
. Back on the *Define retention settings* page, for *Start the retention period based on*, use the dropdown box to select the *Product Cessation* event type that you created.
+
Here's what the settings look like for the Product Specification retention label:
+
image::../media/SPRetention7.png[Settings for the new Product Specification label.]

. Select *Create label*, and on the next page when you see the options to publish the label, auto-apply the label, or just save the label: Select *Just save the label for now*, and then select *Done*.
+
____
[!TIP] For more detailed steps, see link:event-driven-retention.md#step-1-create-a-label-whose-retention-period-is-based-on-an-event[Create a label whose retention period is based on an event].
____

Now let's look at how we'll auto-apply the retention label to product-specification content.

=== Auto-apply retention labels to documents

We're going to use Keyword Query Language (KQL) to xref:apply-retention-labels-automatically.adoc[auto-apply] the retention labels that we created.
KQL is the language that's used to build search queries.
In KQL, you can search by using keywords or managed properties.
For more information, see link:/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference[Keyword Query Language (KQL) syntax reference].

Basically, we want to tell Microsoft 365 to "apply the *Product Specification* retention label to all documents that have a *Status* of *Final* and a *Doc Type* of *Product Specification*." Recall that *Status* and *Doc Type* are the site columns that we defined for the Product Documentation content type in the <<information-architecture,Information architecture>> section.
To do this, we need to configure the search schema.

When SharePoint indexes content, it automatically generates crawled properties for each site column.
For this scenario, we're interested in the *Doc Type* and *Status* properties.
We need documents in the library that are the right content type and have the site columns filled in for search to create the crawled properties.

In the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219[SharePoint admin center], open the Search configuration, and select *Manage Search Schema* to view and configure the crawled properties.

image::../media/SPRetention8.png[Crawled properties in search schema.]

If we type *_status_* in the *Crawled properties* box and select the green arrow, we should see a result like this:

image::../media/SPRetention9.png[The ows_Status crawled property.]

The *ows__Status* property (notice the double underscore) is the one that interests us.
It maps to the *Status* property of the Production Document content type.

Now, if we type *_ows_doc_* and select the green arrow, we should see something like this:

image::../media/SPRetention10.png[The ows_Doc_Type crawled property.]

The *ows_Doc_x0020_Type* property is the second property that interests us.
It maps to the *Doc Type* property of the Production Document content type.

____
[!TIP] To identify the name of a crawled property for this scenario, go to the document library that contains the production documents.
Then go to the library settings.
For *Columns*, select the name of the column (for example, *Status* or *Doc Type*) to open the site column page.
The _Field_ parameter in the URL for that page contains the name of the field.
This field name, prefixed with "ows_", is the name of the crawled property.
For example, the URL `+https://tenantname.sharepoint.com/sites/SpinningWidget/_layouts/15/FldEdit.aspx?List=%7BC38C2F45-3BD6-4C3B-AA3B-EF5DF6B3D172%7D&Field=_Status+` corresponds to the _ows__Status_ crawled property.
____

If the crawled properties you're looking for don't appear in the Manage Search Schema section in SharePoint admin center:

* Maybe the documents haven't been indexed.
You can force a reindex of the library by going to *Document library settings* > *Advanced Settings*.
* If the document library is in a modern site, make sure that the SharePoint admin is also a site collection admin.

For more information about crawled and managed properties, see link:/sharepoint/technical-reference/automatically-created-managed-properties-in-sharepoint[Automatically created managed properties in SharePoint Server].

==== Map crawled properties to pre-defined managed properties

KQL can't use crawled properties in search queries.
It has to use a managed property.
In a typical search scenario, we create a managed property and map it to the crawled property that we need.
However, for auto-applying retention labels, you can only specify pre-defined managed properties in KQL, not custom managed properties.
There's a set of predefined managed properties in the system for string _RefinableString00_ to _RefinableString199_ that you can use.
For a complete list, see link:/sharepoint/manage-search-schema#default-unused-managed-properties[Default unused managed properties].
These default managed properties are typically used for defining search refiners.

For the KQL query to automatically apply the correct retention label to product document content, we map the crawled properties *ows_Doc_x0020_Type* and *ows__Status* to two refinable managed properties.
In our test environment for this scenario, *RefinableString00* and *RefinableString01* aren't being used.
We determined this by looking at *Managed Properties* in *Manage Search Schema* in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219[SharePoint admin center].

link:../media/SPRetention12.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention12.png[Managed properties in search schema.\]]

Notice that the *Mapped Crawled Properties* column in the previous screenshot is empty.

To map the *ows_Doc_x0020_Type* crawled property, follow these steps:

. In the *Managed property* filter box, type *_RefinableString00_* and select the green arrow.
. In the results list, select the *RefinableString00* link, and then scroll down to the *Mappings to crawled properties* section.
. Select *Add a Mapping*, and then type *_ows_Doc_x0020_Type_* in the *Search for a crawled property name* box in the *Crawled property selection* window.
Select *Find*.
. In the results list, select *ows_Doc_x0020_Type* and then select *OK*.
+
In the *Mapped Crawled Properties* section, you should see something similar to this screenshot:
+
link:../media/SPRetention13.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention13.png[Select Add a mapping in the Mapped crawled properties section.\]]

. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select *OK* to save the mapping.

Repeat these steps to map *RefinableString01* and *ows__Status*.

Now you should have two managed properties mapped to the two crawled properties:

link:../media/SPRetention14.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention14.png[Managed properties shown mapped to crawled properties.\]]

Let's verify that our setup is correct by running an enterprise search.
In a browser, go to _https://<your_tenant>.sharepoint.com/search_.
In the search box, type *_RefinableString00:"Product Specification"_* and press enter.
This search should return all documents that have a *Product Specification* of *_Doc Type_*.

Now in the search box, type *RefinableString00:"Product Specification" AND RefinableString01:Final* and press enter.
This should return all documents that have *Product Specification* of *_Doc Type_* and a *Status* of *_Final_*.

==== Create auto-apply label policies

Now that we've verified that the KQL query is working, let's create an auto-apply label policy that uses a KQL query to automatically apply the Product Specification retention label to the appropriate documents.

. In the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149[Microsoft Purview compliance portal], go to *Records management* > *Label policies* > *Auto-apply a label*.
+
link:../media/SPRetention16.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention16.png[Select "Auto-apply a label" on the Labels page\]]

. In the Create auto-labeling policy wizard, on the *Name your auto-labeling policy* page, enter a name such as *Auto-apply Product Specification label*, and an optional description.
Then select *Next*.
. On the *Choose the type of content you want to apply this label to* page, select *Apply label to content that contains specific words or phrases, or properties*, and then select *Next*.
+
link:../media/SPRetention17.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention17.png[Select Apply label to content that contains specific words or phrases, or properties.\]]
+
This option lets us provide the same KQL search query that we tested in the previous section.
The query returns all Product Specification documents that have a status of _Final_.
When we use this same query in the auto-apply label policy, the Product Specification retention label will be automatically applied to all documents that match it.

. On the *Apply label to content matching this query* page, type *RefinableString00:"Product Specification" AND RefinableString01:Final*, and then select *Next*.
+
image::../media/SPRetention19.png[Specify the query in the Keyword query editor box.]

. On the *Choose locations to apply the policy* page, you select the content locations that you want to apply the policy to.
For this scenario, we apply the policy only to SharePoint locations, because all the production documents are stored in SharePoint document libraries.
Toggle the status for *Exchange email*, *OneDrive accounts*, and *Microsoft 365 Groups* to *Off*.
Make sure that the status for SharePoint sites is set to *On* before you select *Next*:
+
image::../media/SPRetentionSPlocations.png[Choose specific sites to auto-apply labels to.]
+
____
[!TIP] Instead of applying the policy to all SharePoint sites, you can select *Choose site* and add the URLs for specific SharePoint sites.
____

. On the *Choose a label to auto-apply* page, select *Add label*.
. From the list of retention labels, select *Product Specification*.
Then select *Add* and *Next*.
. Review your settings:
+
image::../media/SPRetention18.png[Settings to auto-apply the label.]

. Select *Submit* to create the auto-apply label policy.
+
____
[!NOTE] It takes up to 7 days to automatically apply the Product Specification label to all documents that match the KQL search query.
____

==== Verify that the retention label was automatically applied

After 7 days, use xref:data-classification-activity-explorer.adoc[activity explorer] in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to verify that the auto-apply label policy that we created did automatically apply the retention labels to the product documents.

Also look at the properties of the documents in the Document Library.
In the information panel, you can see that the retention label is applied to a selected document.

link:../media/SPRetention21.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention21.png[Verify that label was applied by looking at the document properties in the Document Library.\]]

Because the retention labels were auto-applied to documents, those documents are protected from deletion because the retention label was configured to declare the documents as _records_.
As an example of this protection, we get the following error message when we try to delete one of these documents:

link:../media/SPRetention22.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention22.png[An error message shows that documents can't be deleted because the label declares that the documents are records.\]]

=== Generate the event that triggers the retention period

Now that the retention labels are applied, let's focus on the event that will indicate the end of production for a particular product.
This event triggers the beginning of the retention period that's defined in the retention labels.
For example, for product specification documents, the 5-year retention period begins when the "end of production" event is triggered.

You can manually create the event in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal by going to *Records Managements* > *Events*.
You would choose the event type, set the correct asset IDs, and enter a date for the event.
For more information, see xref:event-driven-retention.adoc[Start retention when an event occurs].

But for this scenario, we'll automatically generate the event from an external production system.
The system is a simple SharePoint list that indicates whether a product is in production.
A link:/power-automate/getting-started[Power Automate] flow that's associated with the list will trigger the event.
In a real-world scenario, you could use various systems to generate the event, such as an HR or CRM system.
Power Automate contains many ready-to-use interactions and building block for Microsoft 365 workloads, such as Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, and Dynamics 365, plus third-party apps such as Twitter, Box, Salesforce, and Workdays.
This feature makes it easy to integrate Power Automate with various systems.
For more information, see link:./event-driven-retention.md#automate-events-by-using-a-rest-api[Automate event-driven retention].

The following screenshot shows the SharePoint list that will be used the trigger the event:

link:../media/SPRetention23.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention23.png[The list that will trigger the retention event.\]]

There are two products currently in production, as indicated by the *_Yes_* in the *In Production* column.
When the value in this column is set to *_No_* for a product, the flow associated with the list will automatically generate the event.
The event triggers the start of the retention period for the retention label that was auto-applied to the corresponding product documents.

For this scenario, we use the following flow to trigger the event:

link:../media/SPRetention24.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention24.png[Configuring the flow that will trigger the event.\]]

To create this flow, start from a SharePoint connector and select the *When an item is created or modified* trigger.
Specify the site address and list name.
Then add a condition based on when the *In Production* list column value is set to *_No_* (or equal to _false_ on the condition card).
Then add an action based on the built-in HTTP template.
Use the values in the following section to configure the HTTP action.
You can copy the values for the *URI* and *Body* properties from the following section and paste them into the template.

* *Method*: POST
* *URI*: `+https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/psws/service.svc/ComplianceRetentionEvent+`
* *Headers*: Key = Content-Type, Value = application/atom+xml
* *Body*:
+
[,xml]
----
  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' standalone='yes'>
  <entry xmlns:d='http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices' xmlns:m='http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata' xmlns='https://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>
  <category scheme='http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/scheme' term='Exchange.ComplianceRetentionEvent'>

  </m:properties>
  </content&gt>
  </entry>
----

This list describes the parameters in the *Body* property of the action that must be configured for this scenario:

* *Name*: This parameter specifies the name of the event that will be created in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
For this scenario, the name is "Cessation Production _xxx_", where _xxx_ is the value of the *ProductName* managed property that we created earlier.
* *EventType*: The value for this parameter corresponds to the event type that the created event will apply to.
This event type was defined when you created the retention label.
For this scenario, the event type is "Product Cessation."
* *SharePointAssetIdQuery*: This parameter defines the asset ID for the event.
Event-based retention needs a unique identifier for the document.
We can use asset IDs to identify the documents that a particular event applies to or, as in this scenario, the metadata column *Product Name*.
To do  this, we need to create a new *ProductName* managed property that can be used in the KQL query.
(Alternatively, we could use *RefinableString00* instead of creating a new managed property).
We also need to map this new managed property to the *ows_Product_x0020_Name* crawled property.
Here's a screenshot of this managed property.
+
link:../media/SPRetention25.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention25.png[Rentention managed property.\]]

* *EventDateTime*: This parameter defines the date that the event occurs.
Use the current date format: +  + _formatDateTime(utcNow(),'yyyy-MM-dd'_)

==== Putting it all together

Now the retention label is created and auto-applied, and the flow is configured and created.
When the value in the *In Production* column for the Spinning Widget product in the Products list is changed from *_Yes_* to *_No_*, the flow is triggered to create the event.
To see this event in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, go to *Records management* > *Events*.

link:../media/SPRetention28.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention28.png[The event that was triggered by the flow is displayed on the Events page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\]]

Select the event to view the details on the flyout page.
Notice that even though the event is created, the event status shows that no SharePoint sites or documents have been processed.

image::../media/SPRetention29.png[Event details.]

But after a delay, the event status shows that a SharePoint site and a SharePoint document have been processed.

image::../media/SPRetention31.png[Event details show that documents were processed.]

This shows that the retention period for the label applied to the Spinning Widget product document has been initiated, based on the event date of the _Cessation Production Spinning Widget_ event.
Assuming that you implemented the scenario in your test environment by configuring a one-day retention period, you can go to the document library for your product documents a few days after the event was created and verify that the document was deleted (after the deletion job in SharePoint has run).

==== More about asset IDs

As the xref:event-driven-retention.adoc[Start retention when an event occurs] article explains, it's important to understand the relationship between event types, retention labels, events, and asset IDs.
The asset ID is simply a document property in SharePoint and OneDrive.
It helps you identify the documents whose retention period will be triggered by the event.
By default, SharePoint has an *Asset Id* property that you can use for event-driven retention:

image::../media/SPRetention26.png[The Asset Id property is displayed on a document properties detail page.]

As the following screenshot shows, the asset ID managed property is called *ComplianceAssetId*.

link:../media/SPRetention27.png#lightbox[image:../media/SPRetention27.png[ComplianceAssetId managed property.\]]

Instead of using the default *Asset Id* property as we do in this scenario, you can use any other property.
But it's important to understand that if you don't specify an asset ID or keywords for an event, all the content that has a label of that event type will get its retention period triggered by the event.

==== Using advanced search in SharePoint

In the previous screenshot, you can see that there's another managed property related to retention labels called *ComplianceTag* that's mapped to a crawled property.
The *ComplianceAssetId* managed property is also mapped to a crawled property.
This means that you can use these managed properties in advanced search to retrieve all documents that have been tagged with a retention label.
