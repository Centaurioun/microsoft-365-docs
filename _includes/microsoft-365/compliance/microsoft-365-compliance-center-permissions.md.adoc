== Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

The Microsoft Purview compliance portal supports directly  managing permissions for users who perform compliance tasks in Microsoft 365.
This update means you'll no longer have to use the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to manage permissions for compliance solutions.
Using the new *Permissions* page in the compliance portal, you can manage permissions to users for compliance tasks in features like device management, Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention, eDiscovery, insider risk management, retention, and many others.
Users can perform only the compliance tasks that you explicitly grant them access to.

To view the *Permissions* tab in the compliance portal, users need to be a global administrator or need to be assigned the _Role Management_ role (a role is assigned only to the _Organization Management_ role group).
The _Role Management_ role allows users to view, create, and modify role groups.

Permissions in the compliance portal are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model.
RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by most Microsoft 365 services, so if you're familiar with the permission structure in these services, granting permissions in the compliance portal will be familiar.
It's important to remember that the permissions managed in the compliance portal don't cover the management of all the permissions needed in each individual service.
You'll still need to manage certain service-specific permissions in the admin center for the specific service.
For example, if you need to assign permissions for archiving, auditing, and MRM retention policies, you'll need to manage these permissions in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104[Exchange admin center].

=== Relationship of members, roles, and role groups

A role grants permissions to do a set of tasks;
for example, the Case Management role lets users work with eDiscovery cases.

A role group is a set of roles that enable users do their jobs across compliance solutions the compliance portal.
For example, by adding users to the _Insider Risk Management_ role group, designated administrators, analysts, investigators, and auditors are configured for the necessary insider risk management permissions in a single group.
The compliance portal includes default role groups for tasks and functions for each compliance solution that you'll need to assign people to.
Generally, we recommend simply adding individual users as members to the default compliance role groups as needed.

=== Permissions needed to use features in the compliance portal

To view all of the default role groups that are available in the compliance portal and the roles that are assigned to the role groups by default, see the link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center[Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center].

Managing permissions in the compliance portal only gives users access to the compliance features that are available within the compliance portal.
If you want to grant permissions to other features that aren't in the compliance portal, such as Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules), you'll need to use the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104[Exchange admin center].

=== Azure roles in the compliance portal

The roles that appear in the *Azure AD* > *Roles* section of the compliance portal *Permissions* page are Azure Active Directory roles.
These roles are designed to align with job functions in your organization's IT group, making it easy to give a person all the permissions necessary to get their job done.
You can view the users currently assigned to each role by selecting an Admin role and viewing the role panel details.
To manage members of an Azure AD role, select Manage members in Azure AD.
This choice redirects you to the Azure management portal.
