* DLP detection of sensitivity labeled email attachments is supported for Open XML-based Office file types only.

** Attachments sent in Teams over 1:1 chat or channels are automatically uploaded to OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.
So if SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business are included as locations in your DLP policy, then labeled attachments sent in Teams will be automatically included in the scope of this condition.
Teams as a location does not need to be selected in the DLP policy.
