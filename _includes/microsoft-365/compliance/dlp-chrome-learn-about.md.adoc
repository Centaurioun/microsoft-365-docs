== Learn about the Microsoft Purview Extension

xref:endpoint-dlp-learn-about.adoc[Endpoint data loss prevention (endpoint DLP)] extends the activity monitoring and protection capabilities of xref:dlp-learn-about-dlp.adoc[Microsoft Purview data loss prevention (DLP)] to sensitive items that are on Windows 10 devices.
Once devices are onboarded into the Microsoft Purview solutions, the information about what users are doing with sensitive items is made visible in xref:data-classification-activity-explorer.adoc[activity explorer] and you can enforce protective actions on those items via xref:create-test-tune-dlp-policy.adoc[DLP policies].

Once the Extension is installed on a Windows 10 device, organizations can monitor when a user attempts to access or upload a sensitive item to a cloud service using Google Chrome and enforce protective actions via DLP.

=== Activities you can monitor and take action on

The extension enables you to audit and manage the following types of activities users take on sensitive items on devices running Windows 10.

|
| file copied to cloud
