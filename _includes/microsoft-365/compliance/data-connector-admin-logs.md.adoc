== View admin logs for data connectors

After you create a data connector to import non-Microsoft data to Microsoft Purview, you can monitor the daily import status of the connector by downloading the admin logs for the data connector.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Audit logging must be enabled for your organization to view admin log.
It is enabled by default for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 organizations, but we strongly recommend that you verify auditing status of your organization.
For instructions to check auditing status, please click here.
For instructions to turn on auditing manually, please click here.
Once auditing is turned on, it could take up to 48 hours to log import events.
We strongly recommend enabling auditing before a connector is configured.
Once a connector is configured, it could take up to 72 hours to generate logs that contains import status summary.
____

If you need to enable auditing for your organization, see link:turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md#turn-on-auditing[Turn on auditing].
* After auditing is turned on, it could take up to 48 hours to generate admin logs for data connectors.
We recommend that you enable auditing before you create data connectors.
* After a data connector is created, it can take up to 72 hours to generate admin logs that contain import status summary.
