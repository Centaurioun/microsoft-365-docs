== Add non-custodial data sources to an eDiscovery (Premium) case

In Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) cases, it doesn't always meet your needs to associate a Microsoft 365 data source with a custodian in the case.
But you may still need to associate that data with a case so that you can search it, add it to a review set, and analyze and review it.
The feature in eDiscovery (Premium) is called _non-custodial data sources_ and lets you add data to a case without having to associate it to a custodian.
It also applies the same eDiscovery (Premium) functionality to non-custodial data that's available for data associated with custodian.
Two of the most useful things that you can apply to non-custodial data is placing it on hold and processing it using xref:indexing-custodian-data.adoc[Advanced indexing].

=== Add a non-custodial data source

Follow these steps to add and manage non-custodial data sources in an eDiscovery (Premium) case.

. On the *eDiscovery (Premium)* home page, click the case that you want to add the data to.
. Click the *Data sources* tab and then click *Add data source* > *Add data locations*.
. On the *New non-custodial data locations* flyout page, choose the data sources that you want to add to the case.
You can add multiple mailboxes and sites by expanding the *SharePoint* or *Exchange* sections and then clicking *Edit*.

Select the sites that you want to add as non-custodian data sources and click *Add*.
 ** *Exchange* - Click *Edit* to add mailboxes.
Type a name or alias (a minimum of three characters) in the search box for mailboxes or distribution groups.
Select the mailboxes that you want to add as non-custodian data sources and click *Add*.

[!NOTE] You can use the *SharePoint* and *Exchange* sections to add sites and mailboxes associated with a Team or Yammer group as non-custodial data sources.
You have to separately add the mailbox and site associated with a Team or Yammer group.
+  + Also, adding a root site URL (such as `+https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/+` or  `+https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/+`) as a SharePoint data source isn't supported.
You have to add specific sites.
____

. After you add non-custodial data sources, you have the option to place those locations on hold or not.
Select or unselect the *Hold* checkbox next to the data source to place it on hold.
. Click *Add* at the bottom of the *New non-custodial data locations* flyout page to add the data sources to the case.
+
Each non-custodial data source that you added is listed on the *Data sources* page.
Non-custodial data sources are identified by the *Data location* value in the *Source type* column.

After you add non-custodial data sources to the case, a job named _Reindexing non-custodial data_ is created and displayed on the *Jobs* tab of the case.
After the job is created, the Advanced indexing process in initiated and the data sources are reindexed.

=== Manage the hold for non-custodial data sources

After you place a hold on a non-custodial data source, a hold policy that contains the non-custodial data sources for the case is automatically created.
When you place other non-custodial data sources on hold, they are added to this hold policy.

. Open the eDiscovery (Premium) case and select the *Hold* tab.
. Click *NCDSHold-<GUID>*, where the GUID value is unique to the case.
+
The flyout page display information and statistics about the non-custodial data sources on hold.

. Click *Edit hold* to view the non-custodial data sources placed on hold and perform the following management tasks:
 ** On the *Locations* page, you can release a non-custodial data source by removing it from the hold.
Releasing a data source doesn't remove the non-custodial data source from the case.
It only removes the hold that was placed on the data source.
 ** On the *Query* page, you can edit the hold to create a query-based hold that is applied to all tha non-custodial data sources in the case.
