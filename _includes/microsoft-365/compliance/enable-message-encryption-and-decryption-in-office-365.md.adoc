== Enable message encryption and decryption

Microsoft Purview Message Encryption lets email users send encrypted messages to people inside our outside their organization.
As an administrator, you can enable Microsoft Purview Message Encryption by creating mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) that set the conditions for encryption.
When one of your users sends a message that matches the conditions of the rule, the message is encrypted.

To learn how to create mail flow rules for encryption, see xref:./define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email.adoc[Define rules to encrypt or decrypt email messages].
