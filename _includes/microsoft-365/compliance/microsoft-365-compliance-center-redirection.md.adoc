== Redirection of users from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

This article explains how automatic redirection works for users accessing compliance solutions from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center (protection.office.com) to the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149[Microsoft Purview compliance portal].

=== What to expect

Automatic redirection is enabled by default for all users accessing compliance-related solutions in Office 365 Security and Compliance (protection.office.com):

* xref:overview-ediscovery-20.adoc[eDiscovery (Premium)]
* xref:communication-compliance.adoc[Communication compliance]
* xref:search-for-content.adoc[Content search]
* xref:get-started-core-ediscovery.adoc[eDiscovery (Standard)]
* xref:data-classification-overview.adoc[Data classification]
* xref:dlp-learn-about-dlp.adoc[Data loss prevention (DLP)]
* link:/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-manage-gdpr-data-subject-requests-with-the-dsr-case-tool[Data subject requests]
* xref:manage-data-governance.adoc[Data lifecycle management] (formerly *Information governance*)

Users are automatically routed to the same compliance solutions in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149[compliance portal].
