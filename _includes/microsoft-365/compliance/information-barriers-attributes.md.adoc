== Information barriers attributes

Certain attributes in Azure Active Directory can be used to segment users in information barriers (IB).
Once segments are defined, those segments can be used as filters for IB policies.
For example, you might use *Department* to define segments of users by department within your organization (assuming no single employee works for two departments at the same time).

This article describes how to use attributes with information barriers, and it provides a list of attributes that can be used.
To learn more about information barriers, see the following resources:

* xref:information-barriers.adoc[Information barriers]
* xref:information-barriers-policies.adoc[Define policies for information barriers in Microsoft Teams]
* xref:information-barriers-edit-segments-policies.adoc[Edit (or remove) IB policies]

=== How to use attributes in IB policies

The attributes listed in this article can be used to define or edit segments of users.
Your defined segments serve as parameters (called _UserGroupFilter_ values) in xref:information-barriers-policies.adoc[IB policies].

. Determine which attribute you want to use to define segments.
(See the <<reference,Reference>> section in this article.)
. Make sure the user accounts have values filled in for the attribute(s) you selected in Step 1.
View user account details, and if necessary, edit user accounts to include attribute values.
 ** To edit multiple accounts (or use PowerShell to edit a single account), see xref:../enterprise/configure-user-account-properties-with-microsoft-365-powershell.adoc[Configure user account properties with Office 365 PowerShell].
 ** To edit a single account, see link:/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal[Add or update a user's profile information using Azure Active Directory].
. link:information-barriers-policies.md#define-segments-using-powershell[Define segments using PowerShell], similar to the following examples:
+
|===
| *Example* | *Cmdlet*

| Define a segment called Segment1 using the Department attribute
| `New-OrganizationSegment -Name "Segment1" -UserGroupFilter "Department -eq 'Department1'"`

| Define a segment called SegmentA using the MemberOf attribute (suppose this attribute contains group names, such as "BlueGroup")
| `New-OrganizationSegment -Name "SegmentA" -UserGroupFilter "MemberOf -eq 'BlueGroup'"`

| Define a segment called DayTraders using ExtensionAttribute1 (suppose this attribute contains job titles, such as "DayTrader")
| `New-OrganizationSegment -Name "DayTraders" -UserGroupFilter "ExtensionAttribute1 -eq 'DayTrader'"`
|===

____
[!TIP] When you define segments, use the same attribute for all your segments.
For example, if you define some segments using _Department_, define all of the segments using _Department_.
Don't define some segments using _Department_ and others using _MemberOf_.
Make sure your segments do not overlap;
each user should be assigned to exactly one segment.
