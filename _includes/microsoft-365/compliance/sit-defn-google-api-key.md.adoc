=== Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used as a simple encrypted string that identifies a https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys[Google REST API client] without any principal that is used to associate API requests with your project for quota and billing.

It uses several primary resources:

* Patterns of Base64 encoded 210 bits symmetric key.
* Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName.
* Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.
* A dictionary of vocabulary.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence.
The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples.
Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
