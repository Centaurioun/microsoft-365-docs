== Search for eDiscovery activities in the audit log

Content Search and eDiscovery-related activities (for Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) and Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium)) that are performed in Microsoft Purview compliance portal or by running the corresponding PowerShell cmdlets are logged in the audit log.
Events are logged when administrators or eDiscovery managers (or any user assigned eDiscovery permissions) perform the following Content Search and eDiscovery (Standard) tasks in the compliance portal:

* Creating and managing eDiscovery (Standard) and eDiscovery (Premium) cases
* Creating, starting, and editing Content searches
* Performing search actions, such as previewing, exporting, and deleting search results
* Managing custodians and review sets in eDiscovery (Premium)
* Configuring permissions filtering for Content search
* Managing the eDiscovery Administrator role

For more information about searching the audit log, the permissions that are required, and exporting search results, see xref:search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.adoc[Search the audit log in the compliance portal].

=== How to search for and view eDiscovery activities

+
____
[!NOTE] The *Activities* drop-down list also includes a group of activities named *eDiscovery cmdlet activities* that will return records from the cmdlet audit log.
____

. Select a date and time range to display eDiscovery events that occurred within that period.
. In the *Users* box, select one or more users to display search results for.
Leave this box blank to return entries for all users.
. Click *Search* to run the search using your search criteria.
. After the search results are displayed, you can click *Filter results* to filter or sort the resulting activity records.
Unfortunately, you can't use filtering to explicitly exclude certain activities.
. To view details about an activity, click the activity record in the list of search results.
+
A *Details* fly out page is displayed that contains the detailed properties from the event record.
To display additional details, click *More information*.
For a description of these properties, see the <<detailed-properties-for-ediscovery-activities,Detailed properties for eDiscovery activities>> section.

. If desired, you can export the audit log search results to a CSV file, and then use the Excel Power Query feature to format and filter these records.
For more information, see xref:export-view-audit-log-records.adoc[Export, configure, and view audit log records].
