Use *Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management* (formerly Microsoft Information Governance) to keep what you need and delete what you don't.

|===
| Step | Description | More information

| 1
| Understand how retention and deletion works for Microsoft 365 services.
+  + After you understand how you can use retention policies and retention labels, identify your workloads that need a retention policy and whether you need to create retention labels for exceptions.
| xref:retention.adoc[Learn about retention policies and retention labels]

| 2
| Create retention policies and if needed, retention labels for exceptions.
+  + The most commonly used retention policies are for Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Yammer.
You can configure exceptions for documents and emails.
| xref:create-retention-policies.adoc[Create retention policies] <p> xref:create-retention-labels-information-governance.adoc[Create and apply retention labels for your exceptions]

| 3
| Manage mailboxes.
+  + Enable mailboxes for archiving and auto-expanding archiving, consider whether you need to customize when emails are moved to the archive mailbox, and make mailboxes inactive when users leave the organization.
| xref:enable-archive-mailboxes.adoc[Enable archive mailboxes] <p> xref:enable-autoexpanding-archiving.adoc[Enable auto-expanding archiving] <p> xref:create-and-manage-inactive-mailboxes.adoc[Create and manage inactive mailboxes]

| 4
| Import PST files to online mailboxes.
+  + If you have PST files that contain data you want to govern, you can import them by using network upload or drive shipping.
| xref:use-network-upload-to-import-pst-files.adoc[Use network upload to import your organization's PST files] <p> xref:use-drive-shipping-to-import-pst-files-to-office-365.adoc[Use drive shipping to import your organization's PST files]

=== Manage high-value items

image::../media/records-management-solution.png[Steps for records management solution]

Use *Microsoft Purview Records Management* to manage your organization's high-value items for business, legal, or regulatory record-keeping requirements.

|===
| Step | Description | More information

| 1
| Understand the records management solution.
+  + Use retention labels with more flexible configuration options and when required, declare items as records.
| xref:records-management.adoc[Learn about records management]

| 2
| Use file plan to manage your retention schedules.
+  + File plan lets you create retention labels interactively or import in bulk, and export for analysis.
Labels that you create with file plan support additional administrative information to help you identify and track business or regulatory requirements.
| xref:file-plan-manager.adoc[Use file plan to create and manage retention labels]

| 3
| Apply your retention labels.
+  + Your retention labels can be published and applied manually or automatically in apps, or automatically applied based on sensitive information, keywords or searchable properties, trainable classifiers, or cloud attachments.
| xref:create-apply-retention-labels.adoc[Publish retention labels and apply them in apps] <p> xref:apply-retention-labels-automatically.adoc[Apply a retention label to content automatically]

| 4
| Manage the permanent deletion of data.
+  + Known as the disposition of data, you can require a manual review of content before it's permanently deleted, and provide proof of disposition for records.
