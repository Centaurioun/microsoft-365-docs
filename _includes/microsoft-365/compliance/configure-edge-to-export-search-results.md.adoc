== Use the eDiscovery Export Tool in Microsoft Edge

As a result of recent changes to the newest version of Microsoft Edge, ClickOnce support is no longer enabled by default.

=== Enable ClickOnce support in Microsoft Edge

. In Microsoft Edge, go to *edge://flags/#edge-click-once*.
. If the existing value is set to *Default* or *Disabled* in the dropdown list, change it to *Enabled*.

NOTE: Organizations can use Group Policy to disable ClickOnce support.
To check if there is an organizational policy for ClickOnce support, go to *edge://policy*.
The following screenshot shows that ClickOnce is enabled across the entire organization.
If this policy value is set to *false*, you will need to contact an admin in your organization.
