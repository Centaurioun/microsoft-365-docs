=== Definition

This SIT is designed to match the security information that's used to access https://api.slack.com/docs/token-type[Slack platform functionalities] (for example Bot tokens, User tokens and App-level tokens).

It uses several primary resources:

* Patterns of Slack user/bot/workspace token.
* Patterns of CredentialName, CredentialFeatures, AccountIdentityName, AccountIdentityValue, ResourceType, ResourceName.
* Patterns of mockup values, redactions, and placeholders.

The patterns are designed to match actual credentials with reasonable confidence.
The patterns don't match credentials formatted as examples.
Mockup values, redacted values, and placeholders, like credential type or usage descriptions, in the position where an actual secret value should present won't be matched.
