== Manage your exact data match schema

=== Editing the schema for EDM-based classification manually

If you want to make changes to your EDM schema, for example the *edm.xml* file, such as changing which fields are used for EDM-based classification, follow these steps:

____
[!TIP] You can change your EDM schema and sensitive information table source file to take advantage of *configurable match*.
When configured, EDM will ignore case differences and some delimiters when it evaluates an item.
This makes defining your xml schema and your sensitive data files easier.
To learn more see, link:sit-get-started-exact-data-match-create-schema.md#using-the-caseinsensitive-and-ignoreddelimiters-fields[Using the caseInsensitive and ignoredDelimiters fields].
____

. Edit your *edm.xml* file (this is the file discussed in the link:sit-get-started-exact-data-match-create-schema.md#create-the-schema-for-exact-data-match-based-sensitive-information-types[Create the schema for exact data match based sensitive information types].
