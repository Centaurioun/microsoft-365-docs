== Learn about named entities

_Named entities_ are xref:sensitive-information-type-learn-about.adoc[sensitive information types] (SIT).
They're complex dictionary and pattern-based classifiers that you can use to detect person names, physical addresses, and medical terms and conditions.
You can see them in the menu:Microsoft Purview compliance portal[Data classification > Sensitive info types].
Here is a partial list of where you can use SITs:

* xref:dlp-learn-about-dlp.adoc[Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention policies (DLP)]
* xref:sensitivity-labels.adoc[Sensitivity labels]
* xref:insider-risk-management-solution-overview.adoc[Insider risk management]
* link:/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps]
* xref:apply-sensitivity-label-automatically.adoc[Microsoft Purview Information Protection]
* xref:information-governance.adoc[Data Lifecycle Management]
* xref:records-management.adoc[Records management]
* xref:ediscovery.adoc[Microsoft Purview eDiscovery]
* xref:/privacy/priva/priva-overview.adoc[Microsoft Priva]
* xref:sit-learn-about-exact-data-match-based-sits.adoc[Exact data match sensitive information types]

DLP makes special use of named entities in _enhanced policy templates_, which are pre-configured DLP policies that you can customize for your organizations needs.
You can also xref:create-test-tune-dlp-policy.adoc[create your own DLP policies] from a xref:create-a-dlp-policy-from-a-template.adoc[blank template]   and use a named entity SIT as a condition.

// There are many other SITs that detect strings like social security, credit card, or bank account numbers to identify sensitive items. For more information, see [Sensitive information types entity definitions](sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions.md).

=== Examples of named entity SITs

Named entity SITs come in two flavors, _bundled_ and _unbundled_

Bundled named entity SITs detect all possible matches.
Use them as broad criteria in your DLP policies for detecting sensitive items.

Unbundled named entity SITs have a narrower focus, like a single country.
Use them when you need a DLP policy with a narrower detection scope.

Here are some examples of named entity SITs.
You can find all of them in xref:sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions.adoc[Sensitive information type entity definitions].

|===
| Named Entity | Description | Bundled/Unbundled

| All full names
| will detect all possible matches of full names

| All physical addresses
| will detect all possible matches of physical addresses
| bundled

| All medical terms and conditions
| will detect all possible matches of medical terms and conditions
| bundled

| Australia Physical Addresses
| Detects patterns related to physical addresses from Australia.
Included in All physical addresses SIT.

=== Examples of enhanced DLP policies

Here are some examples of enhanced DLP policies that use named entity SITs.
You can find all 10 of them in the menu:Microsoft Purview compliance portal[Data loss prevention > Create policy].
Enhanced templates can be used in DLP and auto-labeling.

|===
| Policy category | Template | Description

| Financial
| U.S.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Enhanced
| Helps detect the presence of information subject to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), including information like social security numbers or credit card numbers.
This enhanced template extends the original by also detecting people's full names, U.S./U.K.
passport number, U.S.
driver's license number and U.S.
physical addresses.

| Medical and health
| Australia Health Records Act (HRIP Act) Enhanced
| Helps detect the presence of information commonly considered to be subject to the Health Records and Information Privacy (HRIP) act in Australia, like medical account number and tax file number.
This enhanced template extends the original by also detecting people's full names, medical terms and conditions, and Australia physical addresses.

| Privacy
| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Enhanced
| Helps detect the presence of personal information for individuals inside the European Union (EU) to help meet GDPR privacy obligations.
This enhanced template detects people's full names and physical addresses for countries in the EU.
