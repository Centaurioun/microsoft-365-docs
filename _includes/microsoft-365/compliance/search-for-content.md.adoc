== Search for content using the Content search tool

Use the Content search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to quickly find email in Exchange mailboxes, documents in SharePoint sites and OneDrive locations, and instant messaging conversations in Skype for Business.
You can use the content search tool to search for email, documents, and instant messaging conversations in collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups.

=== Search for content

The first step is to starting using the Content search tool to choose content locations to search and configure a keyword query to search for specific items.
Or, you can just leave the query blank and return all items in the target locations.

=== Perform actions on content you find

After you run a search and refine it as necessary, the next step is to do something with the results returned by the search.
You can export and download the results to your local computer or in the case of a email attack on your organization, you can delete the results of a search from user mailboxes.

=== Learn more about content search

Content search is easy to use, but it's also a powerful tool.
Behind-the-scenes, there's a lot going on.
The more you know about it and understand its behavior and its limitations, the more successful you'll be using it for your organization's search and investigation needs.

* xref:de-duplication-in-ediscovery-search-results.adoc[De-duplication in search results] that you can enable when you export email messages that are the results of a search

=== Use scripts for advanced scenarios

Sometimes you have to perform more advanced, complex, and repetitive content search tasks.
In these cases, it's easier and faster to use commands in Security & Compliance PowerShell.
To help make this easier, we've created a number of Security & Compliance PowerShell scripts to help you complete complex content search-related tasks.

* xref:clone-a-content-search.adoc[Clone a content search] and quickly compare the results of different keyword search queries run on the same content locations;
or use the script to save time by not having to re-enter a large number of content locations when you create a new search
