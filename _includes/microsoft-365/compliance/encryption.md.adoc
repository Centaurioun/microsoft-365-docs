== Encryption

Encryption is an important part of your file protection and information protection strategy.
This article provides an overview of encryption for Office 365.
Get help with encryption tasks like how to set up encryption for your organization and how to password-protect Office documents.

* For information about certificates and technologies like TLS, see xref:technical-reference-details-about-encryption.adoc[Technical reference details about encryption in Office 365].
* For information about how to configure or set up encryption for your organization, see xref:set-up-encryption.adoc[Set up encryption in Office 365 Enterprise].

=== What is encryption, and how does it work in Office 365?

The encryption process encodes your data (referred to as plaintext) into ciphertext.
Unlike plaintext, ciphertext can't be used by people or computers unless and until the ciphertext is decrypted.
Decryption requires an encryption key that only authorized users have.
Encryption helps ensure that only authorized recipients can decrypt your content.
Content includes files, email messages, calendar entries, and so on.

Encryption by itself doesn't prevent content interception.
Encryption is part of a larger information protection strategy for your organization.
By using encryption, you help ensure that only authorized parties can use the encrypted data.

You can have multiple layers of encryption in place at the same time.
For example, you can encrypt email messages and also the communication channels through which your email flows.
With Office 365, your data is encrypted at rest and in transit, using several strong encryption protocols, and technologies that include Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

=== Encryption for data at rest and data in transit

*Examples of data at rest* include files that you've uploaded to a SharePoint library, Project Online data, documents that you've uploaded in a Skype for Business meeting, email messages and attachments that you've stored in folders in your mailbox, and files you've uploaded to OneDrive for Business.

*Examples of data in transit* include mail messages that are in the process of being delivered, or conversations that are taking place in an online meeting.
In Office 365, data is in transit whenever a user's device is communicating with a Microsoft server, or when a Microsoft server is communicating with another server.

With Office 365, multiple layers and kinds of encryption work together to secure your data.
The following table includes some examples, with links to additional information.

=== What if I need more control over encryption to meet security and compliance requirements?

Microsoft 365 provides Microsoft-managed solutions for volume encryption, file encryption, and mailbox encryption in Office 365.
In addition, Microsoft provides encryption solutions that you can manage and control.
These encryption solutions are built on Azure.
