Implement capabilities from *Microsoft Purview Information Protection* (formerly Microsoft Information Protection) to help you discover, classify, and protect sensitive information wherever it lives or travels.

These information protection capabilities give you the tools to <<know-your-data,know your data>>, <<protect-your-data,protect your data>>, and <<prevent-data-loss,prevent data loss>>.

Use the following sections to learn more about the available capabilities and how to get started with each one.
However, if you're looking for a guided deployment, see xref:information-protection-solution.adoc[Deploy an information protection solution with Microsoft Purview].

For information about governing your data for compliance or regulatory requirements, see xref:manage-data-governance.adoc[Govern your data with Microsoft Purview].

=== Know your data

To understand your data landscape and identify sensitive data across your hybrid environment, use the following capabilities:

|===
| Capability | What problems does it solve? | Get started

| xref:sensitive-information-type-learn-about.adoc[Sensitive information types]
| Identifies sensitive data by using built-in or custom regular expressions or a function.
Corroborative evidence includes keywords, confidence levels, and proximity.
| xref:customize-a-built-in-sensitive-information-type.adoc[Customize a built-in sensitive information type]

| xref:classifier-learn-about.adoc[Trainable classifiers]
| Identifies sensitive data by using examples of the data you're interested in rather than identifying elements in the item (pattern matching).
You can use built-in classifiers or train a classifier with your own content.
| xref:classifier-get-started-with.adoc[Get started with trainable classifiers]

| xref:data-classification-overview.adoc[Data classification]
| A graphical identification of items in your organization that have a sensitivity label, a retention label, or have been classified.
You can also use this information to gain insights into the actions that your users are taking on these items.

=== Protect your data

To apply flexible protection actions that include encryption, access restrictions, and visual markings, use the following capabilities:

|===
| Capability | What problems does it solve? | Get started

| xref:sensitivity-labels.adoc[Sensitivity labels]
| A single labeling solution across apps, services, and devices to protect your data as it travels inside and outside your organization.

| link:/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide[Azure Information Protection unified labeling client administrator guide]

| xref:double-key-encryption.adoc[Double Key Encryption]
| Under all circumstances, only your organization can ever decrypt protected content or for regulatory requirements, you must hold encryption keys within a geographical boundary.
| link:double-key-encryption.md#deploy-dke[Deploy Double Key Encryption]

| xref:ome.adoc[Office 365 Message Encryption (OME)]
| Encrypts email messages and attached documents that are sent to any user on any device, so only authorized recipients can read emailed information.
