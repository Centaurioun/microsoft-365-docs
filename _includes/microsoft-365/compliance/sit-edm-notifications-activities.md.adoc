== Create notifications for exact data match activities

When you link:sit-learn-about-exact-data-match-based-sits.md#learn-about-exact-data-match-based-sensitive-information-types[create custom sensitive information types with exact data match (EDM)], there are a number of activities that are created in the link:search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#before-you-search-the-audit-log[audit log].
You can use the link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-protectionalert[New-ProtectionAlert] PowerShell cmdlet to create notifications that let you know when these activities occur:

* `CreateSchema`
* `EditSchema`
* `RemoveSchema`
* `UploadDataFailed`
* `UploadDataCompleted`

[!NOTE]  The ability to create notifications for EDM activities is available for the World Wide and GCC clouds only.

[,powershell]
----
 New-ProtectionAlert -Name "EdmUploadCompleteAlertPolicy" -Category Others -NotifyUser <address to send notification to> -ThreatType Activity -Operation UploadDataCompleted -Description "Custom alert policy to track when EDM upload Completed" -AggregationType None
----
+
For the `UploadDataFailed` you can run:
+
[,powershell]
----
 New-ProtectionAlert -Name "EdmUploadFailAlertPolicy" -Category Others -NotifyUser <SMTP address to send notification to> -ThreatType Activity -Operation UploadDataFailed -Description "Custom alert policy to track when EDM upload Failed" -AggregationType None -Severity High
----
