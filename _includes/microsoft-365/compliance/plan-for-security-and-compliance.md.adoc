== Plan for security & compliance

Managing security and compliance is a partnership.
You are responsible for protecting your data, identities, and devices, while Microsoft vigorously protects Microsoft 365 services.
You can use Microsoft 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) together to help you achieve the appropriate level of protection for your organization.

=== Step 1: Review capabilities

Orient yourself to the information protection capabilities in the Information Protection for Office 365 poster.

=== Step 2: Check your Secure Score

After setting up your Microsoft 365 subscription, take note of your starting score.
Secure Score provides configuration suggestions that you can take to increase your score.
The goal is to be aware of opportunities that you can take to protect your environment which won't negatively affect the productivity of your users.
