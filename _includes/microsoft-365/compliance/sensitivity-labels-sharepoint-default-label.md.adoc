[!NOTE] This feature is in preview and subject to change.
It is also a premium feature with licensing details to be provided when the feature becomes generally available (GA).

To read the preview announcement, see the https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/public-preview-default-label-for-a-document-library-in/ba-p/3585136[blog post].

When SharePoint is xref:sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.adoc[enabled for sensitivity labels], you can configure a default label for document libraries.
Then, any new files uploaded to that library, or existing files edited in the library will have that label applied if they don't already have a sensitivity label, or they have a sensitivity label but with link:sensitivity-labels.md#label-priority-order-matters[lower priority].

For example, you configure the *Confidential* label as the default sensitivity label for a document library.
A user who has *General* as their policy default label saves a new file in that library.
SharePoint will label this file as *Confidential* because of that label's higher priority.
For a quick summary of the possible outcomes, see <<will-an-existing-label-be-overridden,Will an existing label be overridden>> on this page.

A default label offers a baseline level of protection and a form of automatic labeling without content inspection.
To help you distinguish between this feature's default label with the default label in label policies:

* *Default sensitivity label for a document library*: Location-based labeling, applicable only for SharePoint.
Overrides a lower-priority label unless manually applied.
* *Default sensitivity label from a policy*: Always applicable for all locations.
Never overrides an existing label.

When you use Office on the web to create or edit a file, the default sensitivity label for a document library can be applied without delays.
However, labeling is not immediate if you upload a file or create it using Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows, macOS, iOS or Android, and then save to SharePoint:

* File upload: it can take a few minutes for the label to be applied.
* Microsoft 365 Apps: the label is applied after the app is closed.

=== Will an existing label be overridden?

Summary of outcomes:

|===
| Existing label | Override with library default label

| Manually applied, any priority
| No

| Automatically applied, lower priority
| Yes

| Automatically applied, higher priority
| No

| Default label from policy, lower priority
| Yes

| Default label from policy, higher priority
| No
|===

=== Requirements

* You've xref:create-sensitivity-labels.adoc[created and published] sensitivity labels, and they're published to the users who will select a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library.
* You've xref:sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files.adoc[enabled sensitivity labels for Office files in SharePoint and OneDrive].
To check this status, you can run `Get-SPOTenant -EnableAIPIntegration` from the link:/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online[SharePoint Online Management Shell] to confirm the value is set to true.
* link:set-up-irm-in-sp-admin-center.md#irm-enable-sharepoint-document-libraries-and-lists[SharePoint Information Rights Management (IRM) is not enabled for the library].
This older technology isn't compatible with using a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library.
If a library is enabled for IRM, you won't be able to select a default sensitivity label.

=== Limitations

* Doesn't apply to existing files at rest in SharePoint.
* Unless you've xref:sensitivity-labels-coauthoring.adoc[enabled co-authoring for files encrypted with sensitivity labels], you'll see a delay in applying the default sensitivity label for a document library when users select the *File* > *Save as* option.
* As with sensitivity labels for Office for the web, some link:encryption-sensitivity-labels.md#configure-encryption-settings[label configurations that apply encryption] aren't suitable for SharePoint, and so don't support a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library:
 ** *Let users assign permissions when they apply the label* and the checkbox *In Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, prompt users to specify permissions* is selected.
This setting is sometimes referred to as "user-defined permissions".
 ** *User access to content expires* is set to a value other than *Never*.
 ** *Double Key Encryption* is selected.

=== How to configure a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint document library

For an existing document library:

. In SharePoint, navigate to the document library > *Settings* > *Library settings*.
. From the *Library settings* flyout pane, select *Default sensitivity labels*, and then select a label from the drop-down box.
For example:
+
image::../media/default-sensitivity-label-spo2.png[Screenshot that shows configuring a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint library.]
+
Although you see the setting mentions support for PDF files, this file type isn't currently supported for this scenario.

If you're creating a new document library, you can configure the same *Default sensitivity labels* setting from the *Create document library* flyout pane.

The permissions required to set and change a default sensitivity label for a SharePoint library are inherited.
As with the ability to change the library name and description, any SharePoint site member has this permission.

=== Monitoring application of library default sensitivity labels

Use the SharePoint *Sensitivity* column to see the names of sensitivity labels applied to files.
When the label has been applied by this features, the tooltip for the label name displays *This file has been automatically labeled*.
However, this tooltip isn't exclusive to the default sensitivity label for a document library.
It also displays when sensitivity labels are applied by using auto-labeling policies or as a result of a user's default label from sensitivity label policies.

To specifically identify when the label was applied because of the library's default sensitivity label, use the xref:search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.adoc[audit log in the compliance portal] and the *Applied sensitivity label file* auditing event from the *Sensitivity label activities* group.
Then:

. Select an entry to view the details in a flyout pane.
. From the details pane, scroll to the *SensitivityLabelEventData section*, and identify the value for *ActionScourceDetails*.
. A value of *6* is used for when the label was applied because of the default sensitivity label for the document library.

To audit the configuration setting for this feature, use the *Updated list* auditing event from the *SharePoint list activities* group.
In the details flyout pane for the document library, scroll to the *SensitivityLabelEventData* section where *OldSensitivityLabeld* and *SensitivityLabelId* can reflect three changes of states:

* Sensitivity label applied
* Sensitivity label changed from one label to another
* Sensitivity label removed

To map sensitivity label GUIDs to label names, use the link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-label[Get-Label] cmdlet:

. First, link:/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell[connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell].
. Then run the following command, where you specify the GUID:
+
```powershell  Get-Label -Identity "+++<GUID>+++" | Name+++</GUID>+++

=== Next steps

Default labeling ensures a minimum level of protection but doesn't take into account the file contents that might require a higher level of protection.
Consider supplementing this labeling method with xref:apply-sensitivity-label-automatically.adoc[automatic labeling] that uses content inspection, and encourage https://support.microsoft.com/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9[manual labeling] for users to replace the default label when needed.
