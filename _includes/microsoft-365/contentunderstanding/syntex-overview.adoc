== Overview of Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex is a content understanding, processing, and compliance
service that uses intelligent document processing, content artificial
intelligence (AI), and advanced machine learning to automatically and
thoughtfully find, organize, and classify documents in your SharePoint
libraries.

:::row::: :::column span=““::: +
With Syntex, you can automate your content-based processes—capturing the
information in your business documents and transforming that information
into working knowledge for your organization.

....
  Rather than clicking and sorting through hundreds or thousands of files, Syntex extracts, analyzes, and categorizes the data for you.
....

:::column-end::: :::column span=““:::

computers running Syntex.] :::column-end::: :::row-end:::

You can dive deeper into your content to truly understand it, and you
can turn the information into meaningful insights that your organization
can use to make informed business decisions.

=== Models

:::row::: :::column span=“``:::
image:../media/content-understanding/model-generic-image.png[Image of
generic model icon.] :::column-end::: :::column span=''3”:::
Understanding your content with Syntex begins with models. Models let
you identify and classify documents that are uploaded to your SharePoint
document libraries, and then to extract the information you need from
each file.

....
  In Syntex, you can build [custom models](model-types-overview.md) or you can use [prebuilt models](prebuilt-overview.md). 
....

:::column-end::: :::row-end:::

The type of model you choose will depend on the types of files you use,
the format and structure of the files, the information you want to
extract, and where you want to apply the model.

==== Custom models

You build custom models to understand the layout of your files from
example documents. The models learn to look for the data you need to
extract from similar documents. Custom models include:

* link:document-understanding-overview.md[Unstructured document
processing]
* link:freeform-document-processing-overview.md[Freeform document
processing]
* link:form-processing-overview.md[Structured document processing]

|Use this custom model to automatically classify documents and extract
information from them. Use the patterns of the text in example documents
to train the model. Best for Office files and automatic classification
of files. link:document-understanding-overview.md[Learn more] |Use this
custom model to automatically extract information from unstructured
documents. Use the patterns of the text or the layout in example
documents to train the model. Best for a mix of both text and layout
needs. link:freeform-document-processing-overview.md[Learn more] |Use
this custom model to automatically identify field and table values from
structured or semi-structured documents like forms. Best for most
languages and files that include form layouts or tables.

==== Prebuilt models

If you don’t need to build a custom model, you can use a
link:prebuilt-overview.md[prebuilt model]. This type of model is
pretrained to extract predefined entities from common business files.
Prebuilt models include:

* link:prebuilt-model-invoice.md[Invoice processing]
* link:prebuilt-model-receipt.md[Receipt processing]

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]

Syntex].

=== Content assembly

:::row::: :::column span=“``:::
image:../media/content-understanding/document-assembly-image.png[Image
of generic document icon.] :::column-end::: :::column span=''3”::: With
Syntex, you can create _modern templates_ based on the business
documents you use most.

....
  You can then use those templates to automatically generate new documents using SharePoint lists or user entries as a data source.
....

:::column-end::: :::row-end:::

This process lets you automatically generate standard repetitive
business documents, such as contracts, statements of work, service
agreements, letters of consent, and correspondence. You can do all these
tasks quicker, more consistently, and with fewer errors in Syntex.

For more information, see link:content-assembly.md[Create documents
using content assembly in Microsoft Syntex].

=== Advanced metadata search

:::row::: :::column span=``3''::: The advanced metadata search feature
in Syntex lets you perform specific metadata-based queries on SharePoint
document libraries.

....
  You can make faster, more precise queries based on specific metadata column values, rather than just searching for keywords.    
....

:::column-end::: :::column span=““:::
image:../media/content-understanding/search-generic-image.png[Image of
generic search icon.] :::column-end::: :::row-end:::

This feature is useful when you have a specific piece of information you
want to search for, such as when a document was last modified, a
specific person associated with a file, or a specific file type.

For more information, see link:metadata-search.md[Search for metadata in
document libraries in Microsoft Syntex].

=== Content compliance

:::row::: :::column span=“``:::
image:../media/content-understanding/compliance-image.png[Image of
generic compliance icon.] :::column-end::: :::column span=''3”:::
Understanding your content allows for better compliance control and
increases management and governance options for all your data. When
content is properly tagged and labeled, you have better control over
your data and can follow regulations more easily. Syntex helps you
ensure compliance by using retention labels and sensitivity labels to
manage your documents. :::column-end::: :::row-end:::

For more information, see
link:apply-a-retention-label-to-a-model.md[Apply a retention label to a
model in Microsoft Syntex] and
link:apply-a-sensitivity-label-to-a-model.md[Apply a sensitivity label
to a model in Microsoft Syntex].

=== Premium taxonomy services

:::row::: :::column span=``3''::: Having one or more Syntex licenses in
your organization enables the following additional term store features
for admins:

....
  - [SKOS-based term set import](import-term-set-skos.md), which lets you import a term set using a SKOS-based format.      
....

:::column-end::: :::column span=““:::
image:../media/content-understanding/taxonomy-image.png[Image of generic
taxonomy icon.] :::column-end::: :::row-end:::

* link:push-content-type-to-hub.md[Pushing enterprise content types to a
hub site], which also adds them to the associated sites and any newly
created lists or libraries.
* link:term-store-analytics.md[Term store reports], which provides you
insights into published term sets and their use across your
organization.

=== Scenarios and use cases

:::row::: :::column span=“``:::
image:../media/content-understanding/scenarios-image.png[Image of
generic scenario icon.] :::column-end::: :::column span=''3”::: Syntex
can help your organization automate business processes, improve search
accuracy, and manage compliance risk.

....
  With content AI services and capabilities, you can build content understanding and classification directly into the content management flow.
....
