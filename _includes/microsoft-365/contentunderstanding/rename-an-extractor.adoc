== Rename an extractor in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing

At some point, you might need to rename an extractor if you want to
refer to an extracted data field by a different name. For example, your
organization decides to make changes to their contract documents, and
refers to ``customers'' as ``clients'' in their documents. If you were
extracting a ``Customer'' field in your model, you can choose to rename
it to ``Client.''

When you sync your updated model to your SharePoint document library,
you will see a new ``Client'' column in your document library view. Your
view will retain the ``Customer'' column for past activity, but will
update the new ``Client'' column for all new documents that are
processed by your model.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Make sure to sync your updated model to the document
libraries where you had previously applied it for the new column name to
display.
