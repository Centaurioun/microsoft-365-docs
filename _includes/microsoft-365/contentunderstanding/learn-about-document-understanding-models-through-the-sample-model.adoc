== Import a sample model for Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing

Microsoft Syntex provides you with a sample unstructured document
processing model you can use to examine, giving you a better
understanding of how to create your own models. The sample model also
allows you to examine model components, such as its classifier,
extractors, and explanations. You can also use the sample files to train
the model.

=== Import the sample model

To access the sample model, you need to first import the model to your
content center.

[arabic]
. From the content center, select *Models* to see your models list.
. On the *Models* page, select *Import sample model*.

sample model.]
. When the import completes, the *BenefitsChangeNotice* model home page
will open. If you need to open the sample model in the future, you can
open it from the models list in the content center.

page.]

Not only can you look through analyze the sample model to get a better
understanding of how the model is constructed, but as a working model
you can go further and do things such as:

* Add another extractor. For example, add one that extracts the
_discount fee_.
* Apply the model to a document library, and upload some of the training
files to it to see how the model classifies files and extracts data from
them.

=== Get sample models

You can access the https://github.com/pnp/syntex-samples[Syntex Samples
repository], which contains community samples that demonstrate different
usage patterns of unstructured document processing models. The samples
in this repository contain both the model files and the files used to
train the model. Once imported, you can use these models to process
files and to view and edit the classifier and extractors.
