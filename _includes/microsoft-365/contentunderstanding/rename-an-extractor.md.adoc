== Rename an extractor in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

At some point, you might need to rename an extractor if you want to refer to an extracted data field by a different name.
For example, your organization decides to make changes to their contract documents, and refers to "`customers`" as "`clients`" in their documents.
If you were extracting a "`Customer`" field in your model, you can choose to rename it to "`Client.`"

When you sync your updated model to your SharePoint document library, you will see a new "`Client`" column in your document library view.
Your view will retain the "`Customer`" column for past activity, but will update the new "`Client`" column for all new documents that are processed by your model.

____
[!IMPORTANT]  Make sure to sync your updated model to the document libraries where you had previously applied it for the new column name to display.
