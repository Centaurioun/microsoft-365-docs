== Duplicate a model in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing

Duplicating an unstructured document processing model can save you time
and effort if you need to create a new model, and know that an existing
model is very similar to what you need.

For example, an existing model named ``Contracts'' classifies the same
files you need to work with. Your new model will extract some of the
existing data, but will need to be updated to extract some additional
data. Instead of creating and training a new model from scratch, you can
use the duplicate model feature to make a copy of the Contracts model,
which will also copy all associated training items, such as example
files and entity extractors.

When you duplicate the model, after you rename it (for example, to
``Contract Renewals''), you can then make updates to it. For example,
you can choose to remove some of the existing extracted fields that you
don’t need, and then train the model to extract a new one (for example,
``Renewal date'').
