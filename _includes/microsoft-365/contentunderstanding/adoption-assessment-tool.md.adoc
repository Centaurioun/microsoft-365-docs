____
[!NOTE] The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can be run only against SharePoint Online.

You can assess how SharePoint Syntex will benefit your organization by using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool.
When you run an assessment, you'll generate a Power BI report that summarizes aspects of your SharePoint information architecture that are indicators for where SharePoint Syntex might be of value.

The assessment report includes the following information:

* *Libraries with custom columns* -- Identify libraries where SharePoint Syntex can automatically populate columns, improving consistency.
* *Column usage* -- Identify patterns of column usage, to target SharePoint Syntex models where they'll have the maximum benefit.
* *Libraries with custom content types* -- Identify libraries using custom content types, where SharePoint Syntex models can be used to automatically categorize files.
* *Content type usage* -- Identify patterns of content type usage, to target SharePoint Syntex models where they'll have the maximum benefit.
* *Libraries with retention labels* -- Identify libraries where retention labels are used, where SharePoint Syntex can be used to automate and improve consistency.
* *Library size* -- Identify large libraries where classification and metadata can improve the content discovery experience.
* *Library modernization status* -- Identify libraries that might need to be modernized to fully make use of SharePoint Syntex.
* *Prebuilt model candidates* -- Identify libraries where names or content types suggest a prebuilt model could be applied.
