You can easily apply a xref:../compliance/retention.adoc[retention label] to a model in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex.
You can do this for both document understanding and form processing models.

Retention labels let you apply retention settings to the documents that your models identify.
For example, you want your model to not only identify any _Insurance notice_ documents that are uploaded to your document library, but to also apply a _Business_ retention tag to them so that these documents cannot be deleted from the document library for the specified time period (the next five months, for example).

You can apply a pre-existing retention label to your model through your model settings on your model's home page.

____
[!Important] For retention labels to be available to apply to your document understanding models, they need to be link:../compliance/file-plan-manager.md#create-retention-labels[created] and link:../compliance/create-apply-retention-labels.md#how-to-publish-retention-labels[published] in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
____

=== To add a retention label to a document understanding model

. From the model home page, select *Model settings*.</br>
. In *Model settings*, in the *Security and compliance* section, select the *Retention label* menu to see a list of retention labels that are available for your to apply to the model.</br>  image:../media/content-understanding/retention-labels-menu.png[Retention label menu.]</br>
. Select the retention label you want to apply to the model, and then select *Save*.</br>

After applying the retention label to your model, you are able to apply it to a:

* New document library
* Document library to which the model is already applied

=== Apply the retention label to a document library to which the model is already applied

If your document understanding model has already been applied to a document library, you can do the following to sync your retention label update to apply it to the document library:</br>

. On your model home page, in the *Libraries with this model* section, select the document library to which you want to apply the retention label update.
</br>
. Select *Sync*.
</br>  image:../media/content-understanding/sync-model.png[Sync model.]</br>

After applying the update and syncing it to your model, you can confirm that it has been applied by doing the following:

. In the content center, in the *Libraries with this model* section, click on the library to which your updated model was applied.
</br>
. In your document library view, select the information icon to check the model properties.</br>
. In the *Active models* list, select your updated model.</br>
. In the *Retention label* section you will see the name of the applied retention label.</br>

On your model's view page in your document library, a new *Retention label* column will display.
As your model classifies files it identifies as belonging to it's content type and lists them in the library view, the Retention label column will also display the name of the retention label that has been applied to it through the model.

For example, all _Insurance notice_ documents that your model identifies will also have the _Business_ retention label applied to them, preventing them from being deleted from the document library for five months.
If an attempt is made to delete the file from the document library, an error will display saying it is not allowed because of the applied retention label.
