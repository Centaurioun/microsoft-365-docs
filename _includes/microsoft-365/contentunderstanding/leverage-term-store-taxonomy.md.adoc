When you create an extractor in your document understanding model using SharePoint Syntex, you can take advantage of global term sets in the link:/sharepoint/managed-metadata[term store] to display preferred terms for data that you extract.

As an example, your model identifies and classifies all *Contract* documents that are uploaded to the document library.
Additionally, the model also extracts a *Contract Service* value from each contract, and will display it in a column in your library view.
Among the various Contract Services values in the contracts, there are several older values that your company no longer uses and have been renamed.
For example, all references to the terms _Design_, _Graphics_, or _Topography_ contract services should now be called _Creative_.
Whenever your model extracts one of the outdated terms from a contract document, you want it to display the current term - Creative - in your library view.
In the example below, while training the model we see that one sample document contains the outdated term of _Design_.

=== Use a Managed metadata column in your extractor

Term sets are configured in the Managed Metadata services (MMS) term store in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219[SharePoint admin center].
In the example below, the _Contract Services_ link:/sharepoint/managed-metadata#term-set[term set] is configured to include several terms, including _Creative_.
The details for it show that the term has three synonyms (_Design_, _Graphics_, and _Topography_) and the synonyms should be translated to _Creative_.

There could be many reasons why you might want to use a synonym in your term set.
For example, there could be outdated terms, renamed terms, or variations between your organizations departments on naming.

To make the managed metadata field available to select when you create your extractor in your model, you need to https://support.microsoft.com/office/8fad9e35-a618-4400-b3c7-46f02785d27f[add it as a managed-metadata site column].
After you add the site column, you can select it when you create the extractor for your model.

After applying your model to the document library, when documents are uploaded to library, the _Creative Services_ column will display the preferred term (_Creative_) when the extractor finds any of the synonym values (_Design_, _Graphics_, and _Topography_).

[!NOTE] If the term set is open, then any extracted values that do not match a preferred term or synonym value will be added as a new term to the root of the term set.
These new terms can be moved, merged, or made synonyms in the term store where the term set resides.
