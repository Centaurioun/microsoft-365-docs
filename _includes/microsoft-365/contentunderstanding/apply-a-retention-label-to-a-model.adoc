== Apply a retention label to a model in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing   |   ✓ Structured
document processing  |   ✓ All prebuilt models

You can easily apply a link:../compliance/retention.md[retention label]
to a model in Microsoft Syntex.

____
[!Note] Retention labels are not yet available for Freeform document
processing models.
____

Retention labels let you apply retention settings to the documents that
your models identify. For example, you want your model to not only
identify any _Insurance notice_ documents that are uploaded to your
document library, but to also apply a _Business_ retention tag to them
so that these documents can’t be deleted from the document library for
the specified time period (the next five months, for example).

You can apply a pre-existing retention label to your model through your
model settings on your model’s home page.

=== Add a retention label to an unstructured document processing model or a prebuilt model

____
[!Important] For retention labels to be available to apply to your
unstructured document processing or prebuilt models, they need to be
link:../compliance/file-plan-manager.md#create-retention-labels[created]
and
link:../compliance/create-apply-retention-labels.md#how-to-publish-retention-labels[published]
in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
____

[arabic]
. From the model home page, select *Model settings*.
. In *Model settings*, in the *Security and compliance* section, select
the *Retention label* menu to see a list of retention labels that are
available for you to apply to the model.

label menu.]

[arabic, start=3]
. Select the retention label you want to apply to the model, and then
select *Save*.

After applying the retention label to your model, you’re able to apply
it to a:

* New document library
* Document library to which the model is already applied

==== Apply the retention label to a document library to which the model is already applied

If your unstructured document processing model or prebuilt model has
already been applied to a document library, you can do the following to
sync your retention label update to apply it to the document library:

[arabic]
. On your model home page, in the *Libraries with this model* section,
select the document library to which you want to apply the retention
label update.
. Select *Sync*.

After applying the update and syncing it to your model, you can confirm
that it has been applied by doing the following steps:

[arabic]
. In the content center, in the *Libraries with this model* section,
select the library to which your updated model was applied.
. In your document library view, select the information icon to check
the model properties.
. In the *Active models* list, select your updated model.
. In the *Retention label* section, you’ll see the name of the applied
retention label.

On your model’s view page in your document library, a new *Retention
label* column will display. As your model classifies files it identifies
as belonging to its content type and lists them in the library view, the
*Retention label* column will also display the name of the retention
label that has been applied to it through the model.

For example, all _Insurance notice_ documents that your model identifies
will also have the _Business_ retention label applied to them,
preventing them from being deleted from the document library for five
months. If an attempt is made to delete the file from the document
library, an error will display saying it isn’t allowed because of the
applied retention label.

=== Add a retention label to a structured document processing model

____
[!Important] For retention labels to be available to apply to your
structured document processing models, they need to be
link:../compliance/file-plan-manager.md#create-retention-labels[created]
and
link:../compliance/create-apply-retention-labels.md#how-to-publish-retention-labels[published]
in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
____

You can either apply a retention label to a structured document
processing model when you’re creating a model, or apply it to an
existing model.

==== To add a retention label when you create a structured document processing model

[arabic]
. When you’re link:./create-a-form-processing-model.md[creating a new

menu and then select the retention label you want to apply to the model.

. After you’ve completed your remaining model settings, select *Create*
to build your model.

==== To add a retention label to an existing structured document processing model

You can add a retention label to an existing structured document
processing model in different ways:

* Through the *Automate* menu in the document library
* Through the *Active model* settings in the document library

===== To add a retention label to an existing structured document processing model through the Automate menu

You can add a retention label to an existing structured document
processing model that you own through the *Automate* menu in the
