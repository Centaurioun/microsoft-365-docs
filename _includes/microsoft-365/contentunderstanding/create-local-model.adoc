== Create a model on a local SharePoint site with Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ All custom models   |   ✓ All trained models

Microsoft Syntex provides an option to create and train models locally
on your own SharePoint site. These models can be used only on the site
where they’re created.

____
[!NOTE] If you want to make your model discoverable and available for
other users, you need to create an _enterprise model_. An enterprise
model is a model that is created and trained in the
link:create-a-content-center.md[content center].
____

By activating document classification and extraction on your SharePoint
site, Syntex lets you classify files in document libraries, extract
information from new files, and automate activities based on extracted
information.

When you activate local model creation, the following lists and
libraries will be added to your site:

* Models document library
* Training files document library
* Explanation templates list
* Model usage list

A model is automatically promoted to the current site only when the
model first has been applied to any library in the site. This makes the
model discoverable in the list of available site models and available
for any other library in the site. Until the model is applied to a
library in the site, it is unavailable. Similarly, when a model is
removed from all the libraries in the site, it is also removed from the
list of available site models.

This feature is available for all link:model-types-overview.md[model
types].
