To make important content types more consistently available to
SharePoint libraries and lists, you can push them to the hubs that you
choose. Pushing the content types automatically adds them to any new
lists and libraries created on the sites associated with the hub, and to
any new sites added to the hub. This feature requires a
link:syntex-licensing.md[Microsoft Syntex license].

For this feature to work, the content types being pushed must already be
published.

To push content types to hubs

[arabic]
. In the SharePoint admin center, expand *Content services*, and then
select *Content type gallery*.
. Select the content type that you want to push to hubs.
. Select *Edit* in the command bar.
. Select *Choose hub sites*.
. Select the hub sites you want and then choose *OK*.
. Choose *Save*.

When you push a content type to an existing hub & its existing
associated sites for the first time, it can take up to an hour from when
the hub or associated sites are visited, for the settings to update in
the site. Any new associations to the hub wonâ€™t require this wait and
will have the settings reflected in a few minutes.

After the settings are updated, the content type with these settings
will be available in any newly associated site with the hub in a few
minutes. The default library view will be changed to one of these
automatically created views. If there are multiple content types pushed
to the same library, then the latest one (based on the order of the
action of pushing those content types to the hub this library belongs
to) is what will be set as the default view. Then, any new list or
library created will have the content type automatically added to it
within a few minutes of creation. A pushed content type will be added to
a document library only if it derives directly or indirectly from the
Document content type, and a content type will be added to a list only
if it does not derive from the Document content type directly or
indirectly.
