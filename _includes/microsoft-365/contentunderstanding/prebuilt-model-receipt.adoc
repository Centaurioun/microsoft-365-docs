== Use a prebuilt model to extract information from receipts in Microsoft Syntex

The prebuilt _receipts model_ in Microsoft Syntex analyzes and extracts
key information from sales receipts. The API recognizes printed and
handwritten receipts and
link:/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/concept-receipt#field-extraction[extracts
key receipt information], such as merchant name, merchant phone number,
transaction date, tax, and transaction total. Receipts can be of various
formats and quality including printed and handwritten receipts.

To use a receipts model, follow these steps:

* link:#step-2-upload-an-example-file-to-analyze[Step 2: Upload an
example file to analyze]
* link:#step-3-select-extractors-for-your-model[Step 3: Select
extractors for your model]
* link:#step-4-apply-the-model[Step 4: Apply the model]

=== Step 1: Create a receipts model

Follow the instructions in link:create-syntex-model.md[Create a model in
Syntex] to create a prebuilt receipts model. Then continue with the
following steps to complete your model.

=== Step 2: Upload an example file to analyze

[arabic]
. On the *Models* page, in the *Add a file to analyze* section, select
*Add file*.

. On the *Files to analyze the model* page, select *Add* to find the
file you want to use.

. On the *Add a file from the training files library* page, select the
file, and then select *Add*.

of the Add a file from the training files library page.]
. On the *Files to analyze the model* page, select *Next*.

=== Step 3: Select extractors for your model

On the extractor details page, you’ll see the document area on the right
and the *Extractors* panel on the left. The *Extractors* panel shows the
list of extractors that have been identified in the document.

The entity fields that are highlighted in green in the document area are
the items that were detected by the model when it analyzed the file.
When you select an entity to extract, the highlighted field will change
to blue. If you later decide not to include the entity, the highlighted
field will change to gray. The highlights make it easier to see the
current state of the extractors you have selected.

[!TIP] You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse or the controls at the
bottom of the document area to zoom in or out as needed to read the
entity fields.

==== Select an extractor entity

You can select an extractor either from the document area or from the
*Extractors* panel, depending on your preference.

* To select an extractor from the document area, select the entity
field.

* To select an extractor from the *Extractors* panel, select the
checkbox to the right of the entity name.
+

When you select an extractor, a *Select extractor?* box is displayed in
the document area. The box shows the extractor name, the original value,
and the option to select it as an extractor. For certain data types such
as numbers or dates, it will also show an extracted value.

of the Select extractor box on the extractor details page.]

The original value is what is actually in the document. The extracted
value is what will be written into the column in SharePoint. When the
model is applied to a library, you can use column formatting to specify
how you want it to look in the document.

Continue to select additional extractors you want to you use. You can
also add other files to analyze for this model configuration.

==== Rename an extractor

You can rename an extractor either from the model home page or from the
*Extractors* panel. You might consider renaming selected extractors
because these names will be used as the column names when the model is
applied to the library.

To rename an extractor from the model home page:

[arabic]
. In the *Extractors* section, select the extractor you want to rename,
and then select *Rename*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-model-page-rename-extractor.png[Screenshot
of the Extractors section with the Rename option highlighted.]
. On the *Rename entity extractor* panel, enter the new name of the
extractor, and then select *Rename*.

To rename an extractor from the *Extractors* panel:

[arabic]
. Select the extractor you want to rename, and then select *Rename*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-extractors-panel-rename-field.png[Screenshot
of the Extractors panel showing how to rename an extractor.]
. In the *Rename extractor* box, enter the new name of the extractor,
and then select *Rename*.

=== Step 4: Apply the model

* To save changes and return to the model home page, on the *Extractors*
panel, select *Save and exit*.
* If you’re ready to apply the model to a library, in the document area,
select *Next*. On the *Add to library* panel, choose the library to
which you want to add the model, and then select *Add*.

=== Change the view in a document library

view of a document library, see link:choose-library-view.md[Choose the
view in a document library].
