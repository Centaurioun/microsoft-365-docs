== Set up SharePoint Syntex

Admins can use the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339[Microsoft 365 admin center] to set up xref:index.adoc[Microsoft SharePoint Syntex].

Consider the following before you start:

* In which SharePoint sites will you enable form processing?
All of them, some, or select sites?
* What will you name your default content center?

You can change your settings after initial setup in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339[Microsoft 365 admin center].

Prior to setup, make sure to plan for the best way to set up and configure content understanding in your environment.
For example, you need to make the following decisions:

* The SharePoint sites in which you want to enable form processing - all of them, some, or selected sites
* The name and admins for your content center

=== Requirements

____
[!NOTE] You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and set up SharePoint Syntex.
____

As an admin, you can also make changes to your selected settings anytime after setup, and throughout the content understanding management settings in the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339[Microsoft 365 admin center].

==== Custom Power Platform environments

If you plan to use a custom Power Platform environment, you must install the _AI Builder for Project Cortex_ app in this environment.
See link:/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#install-an-app-in-the-environment-view[Manage Dynamics 365 apps] for details and look for the _AI Builder for Project Cortex_ app in the list of Dynamics 365 apps.

You also need to link:/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on[allocate AI Builder credits] to the custom environment before you can create form processing models.

When using a custom environment, model creators must be assigned the Environment Maker security role and model users must be assigned the Basic User security role.
See link:/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles[Assign a security role to a user] for more information.

Users creating models in a link:/microsoft-365/contentunderstanding/create-a-content-center[content center site] must be site members.
Users creating models locally outside the content center must be site owners of those sites.

==== Licensing

To use SharePoint Syntex, your organization must have a subscription to SharePoint Syntex, and each user must have a licenses assigned.
SharePoint Syntex licenses include the following apps, which must all be assigned:

* SharePoint Syntex
* SharePoint Syntex - SPO type
* Common Data Service for SharePoint Syntex

To use form processing, you also need AI Builder credits.
For each licensed user of SharePoint Syntex, an allocation of AI Builder credits is provided each month.
