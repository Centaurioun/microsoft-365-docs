== Import a term set using a SKOS-based format

You can import a term set using a SKOS-based format. For details about
the format, see link:skos-format-reference.md[SharePoint taxonomy SKOS
format reference]. This feature requires a
link:syntex-licensing.md[Microsoft Syntex license].

We recommend keeping your import files to less than 20,000 terms. Larger
files can increase the time taken for validation and import.

[arabic]
. In the SharePoint admin center, expand *Content services*, and then
select *Term store*.
. Select the term group where you want to import the term set.
. In the command bar, click *Import term set*.
. If you want to download a sample file to use as a template, click
*sample-metadata.ttl* to get a sample file that uses the SKOS-based
format.
. Create the import file that contains the term sets & terms you wish to
import.
. Under *File format*, select **SKOS (*.ttl)**.
. Click *Browse* and navigate to and add your import file.
. Click *Import*. Do not close the panel until the import completes.

On successful import of the file, a success message will be displayed,
and the term store will refresh and you can navigate to the newly
created term sets.
