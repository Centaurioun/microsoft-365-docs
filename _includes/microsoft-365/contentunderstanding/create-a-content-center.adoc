== Create a content center in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ All custom models   |   ✓ All prebuilt models

To create and manage enterprise models, you first need a content center.
The content center is the model creation interface and also contains
information about which document libraries published models have been
applied to.

doc library.]

You create a default content center during
link:set-up-content-understanding.md[setup]. But a SharePoint admin can
also choose to create additional centers as needed. While a single
content center might be fine for environments for which you want a
roll-up of all model activity, you might want to have additional centers
for multiple departments within your organization, which might have
different needs and permission requirements for their models.

Additionally, if you want to try Syntex, you can create a content center
using the instructions in this article without purchasing licenses.
Unlicensed users can create models but can’t apply them to a document
library.

____
[!NOTE] In a link:../enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo.md[Microsoft 365
Multi-Geo environment], if you have a single default content center in
your central location, you can only provide a roll-up of model activity
from within that location. You currently cannot get a roll-up of model
activity across farm-boundaries in Multi-Geo environment.

=== Create a content center

A SharePoint admin can create a content center site like they would
link:/sharepoint/create-site-collection[create any other SharePoint
site] through the admin center site provisioning panel.

To create a new content center:

[arabic]
. On the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the *SharePoint admin center*
> *Active sites*.
. On the *Active sites* page, select *Create*, and then select *Other
options*.
. On the *Choose a template* menu, select *Content center*.
. For the new site, provide a *Site name*, *Primary administrator*, and
a *Language*.
+
____
[!NOTE] You can select a content center site to render in any of the
available languages, but note that currently models can only be created
for English files. Also note that like other site templates, the default
site language isn’t editable after the site is created.
____
. Select *Finished*.

After you create a content center site, you’ll see it listed on *Active
sites* in the SharePoint admin center.

==== Give access to additional users

After you create the site, you can give additional users access to the
site through the standard
link:/sharepoint/modern-experience-sharing-permissions[SharePoint site
permissions model].

==== Roll up of models in the default content center

In Syntex, the first content center created during setup is the _default
content center_. If subsequent content centers are created, their models
are shown in the default content center view.

of the Model library in the default content center.]

The *Models* library in the default content center view groups the
created models by content center for a summary view of all models that
have been created.

____
[!NOTE] You can’t change the designated default content center. It’s
always the first content center created during setup.
