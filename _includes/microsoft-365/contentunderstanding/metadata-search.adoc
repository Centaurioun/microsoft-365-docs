== Use metadata to find content in document libraries in Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex gives you the ability to quickly search through your
document’s metadata with ease. The Syntex content query feature lets you
perform specific metadata-based queries on SharePoint document
libraries. You can make faster, more precise queries based on specific
metadata column values, rather than just searching for keywords.

Syntex content query lets you use the metadata associated with a
document to help locate the file in a SharePoint document library. This
feature is particularly useful when you have a specific piece of
information you want to search for, such as when a document was last
modified, a specific person associated with a file, or a specific file
type.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Use this field to
|Keywords |Search for a string match in metadata or in the full text of
a document.

|File name |Search in the *Name* column in the library.

|People |Search for a match on people in any column in the library.

|Modified date |Search by selected date range in the *Modified* column
in the library.

|File type |Search by selected file type (for example, Word document or
PDF).

|Content type |Search by selected content type. This option will only
appear if there’s a non-default content type applied to the library.
Default content types are _document_ and _folder_.
|===
. You can also search for custom site columns that are in the current
library view. This is especially useful if you have a model running on
the library because the metadata extractors automatically populate
information into site columns.
+
To add a custom site column to your query, select *Add more options*,
and then select the name of the site column.
+

+
For numbers, currency, and date columns, you can scope parameters of the
query—for example, greater than a specific amount or within a specific
period of time. For text columns, you can specify if you want to contain
or not contain certain words.
. Select *Search*. The documents that match your metadata query are
shown on the results page.
