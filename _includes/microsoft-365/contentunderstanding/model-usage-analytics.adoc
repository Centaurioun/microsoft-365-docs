== Analyze how your models are used in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ All custom models   |   ✓ All prebuilt models

Your content center in Microsoft Syntex provides you model usage
analytics to provide more information about how your models that have
been published from the content center are being used. The *How your
models are performing in the last 30 days* section of the content center
includes a 30 day roll-up of usage analytics data provided in the
following charts and lists:

* Classification by model
* Classification by library
* Model usage

=== Roll up of model usage data in the default content center

In Syntex, the default content center is created during setup. More
content centers can also be created as needed. For example, departments
might create their own content centers to create and manage their
models.

Regarding model usage analytics, note that:

* Your default content center will show model usage analytics for all
content centers and models in your organization, including ones created
in other content centers. This gives content managers and other
stakeholders a centralized portal to manage and oversee the content
centers and models across the company.
* Other content centers will only show model usage analytics for the
models that were created in them. This gives content managers insights
into usage data for only the models they’re concerned with.

=== Classification by model

model percentage.]

The *Classification by model* pie chart displays which models have
classified the most files. It shows each published model as a percentage
of the total files processed by all published models on the content
center.

Each model also shows the *Completeness Rate*, the percentage of
uploaded files that were successfully analyzed by the model. A low
completeness rate may mean that there are issues with either the model
or the files that are being analyzed.

=== Classification by library

processed.]

The *Classification by library* bar chart helps you determine the
effectiveness of content understanding in your organization. It shows
you not only the number of files processed over time for each model, but
by selecting a column in chart, it will also show you the document
libraries to which the model was applied.

=== Model usage

The model usage list shows usage analytics for the models created
through the content center.

____
[!NOTE] If you are in the default content center and have additional
content centers in your organization, the model usage list will be
grouped by content center.
____

Each model in the model usage list will show the usage data:

* Classified item count: Number of files processed by the model.
* Average confidence score: Average accuracy score of the model when run
against files.
* Target list URL: The SharePoint document library to which the model is
applied.
