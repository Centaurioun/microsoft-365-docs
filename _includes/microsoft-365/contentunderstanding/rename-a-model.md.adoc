== Rename a model in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

At some point, you might want to rename a document understanding model.
A common example is when you create an initial draft of a model, you might not have given a lot of thought as to the final name (for example, you might have named it "`AlexWilburModel1`").
As you come closer to finalizing the model and putting it to use, you realize that a more proper name would be "`Contract Renewals,`" and you want to rename it.

Another example is when your organization makes a decision to refer to a process or document type by a different name.
For example, after you create your model and are ready to apply it, your organization might mandate that all "`Contracts`" will now formally be referred to as "`Agreements.`" If needed, you can choose to rename your model from "`Contract Renewals`" to "`Agreement Renewals.`"

[!IMPORTANT] You can only rename a document understanding model if it has not been applied to a document library.
