== Form processing overview in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

Microsoft SharePoint Syntex uses Microsoft Power Apps link:/ai-builder/overview[AI Builder] form processing to create models within SharePoint document libraries.

You can use AI Builder form processing to create AI models that use machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from structured or semi-structured documents, such as forms and invoices.

Organizations often receive invoices in large quantities from various sources, such as mail, fax, and email.
Processing these documents and manually entering them into a database can take a considerable amount of time.
By using AI to extract the text, key/value pairs, and tables from your documents, form processing automates this process.

____
[!NOTE] See the xref:./adoption-getstarted.adoc[SharePoint Syntex adoption: Get started guide] for more information about form processing scenario examples.

For example, you can create a form processing model that identifies all purchase order documents that are uploaded to the document library.
From each purchase order, you can then extract and display specific data that is important to you, such as _PO Number_, _Date_, or _Total Cost_.

You use example files to train your model and define the information to be extracted from your form.
The layout of your document is learned by training your model.
You only need five form documents to get started.
AI Builder will analyze your example files for key-value pairs, and you can also manually identify ones that might not have been detected.
AI builder lets you test the accuracy of your model on your example files.

After you train and publish your model, your model creates a link:/power-automate/getting-started[Power Automate flow].
The flow runs when a file is uploaded to the SharePoint document library and will extract data that has been identified in the model.
The extracted data will display in columns in your model's document library view.

An Office 365 admin needs to xref:./set-up-content-understanding.adoc[enable form processing] for the SharePoint document library for users to be able to xref:create-a-form-processing-model.adoc[create a form processing model] in it.
You can select the sites during setup, or after setup in your management settings.

=== File limitations

When using form processing models, make sure to note the link:/ai-builder/form-processing-model-requirements[requirements and limitations for file usage].

=== Supported languages

Form processing supports documents in more than 73 languages.
For the list of languages, see link:/power-platform-release-plan/2021wave2/ai-builder/form-processing-new-language-support[Form processing language support].

=== Multi-Geo environments

When setting up SharePoint Syntex in a xref:../enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo.adoc[Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo environment], you can only configure it to use form processing in the central location.
If you want to use form processing in a satellite location, contact Microsoft support.

=== Custom environments

If you use a custom environment (rather than the default environment) for Power Platform processing, there are additional setup requirements.
For more information, see link:set-up-content-understanding.md#requirements[Custom Power Platform environments].
