== Discover opportunities in Microsoft Syntex by using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool

____
[!NOTE] The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can be run only against
SharePoint Online.
____

You can assess how Microsoft Syntex will benefit your organization by
using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you run an assessment,
you’ll generate a Power BI report that summarizes aspects of your
SharePoint information architecture that are indicators for where Syntex
might be of value.

The assessment report includes the following information:

* *Libraries with custom columns* – Identify libraries where Syntex can
automatically populate columns, improving consistency.
* *Column usage* – Identify patterns of column usage, to target Syntex
models where they’ll have the maximum benefit.
* *Libraries with custom content types* – Identify libraries using
custom content types, where Syntex models can be used to automatically
categorize files.
* *Content type usage* – Identify patterns of content type usage, to
target Syntex models where they’ll have the maximum benefit.
* *Libraries with retention labels* – Identify libraries where retention
labels are used, where Syntex can be used to automate and improve
consistency.
* *Library size* – Identify large libraries where classification and
metadata can improve the content discovery experience.
* *Library modernization status* – Identify libraries that might need to
be modernized to fully make use of Syntex.
* *Prebuilt model candidates* – Identify libraries where names or
content types suggest a prebuilt model could be applied.
* *Syntex model usage* – Review the current use of Syntex models in your
sites.
* *Assessment overview* – Review the assessment results to identify any
failures.
