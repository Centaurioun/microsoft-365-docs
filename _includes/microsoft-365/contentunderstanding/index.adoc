=== Get started

The resources in this section help you learn more about the methods of
data classification and extraction used by SharePoint Syntex. There are
two custom model types—link:document-understanding-overview.md[document
understanding] and link:form-processing-overview.md[form processing]—and
a link:prebuilt-overview.md[prebuilt] model type.

____
[!NOTE] You can get started with SharePoint Syntex without buying
licenses by link:create-a-content-center.md[creating a content center
from the SharePoint admin center]. Unlicensed users can create document
understanding models but can’t apply them to a document library.
