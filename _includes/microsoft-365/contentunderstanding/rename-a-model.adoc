== Rename a model in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ All custom models   |   ✓ All prebuilt models

At some point, you might want to rename a model. A common example is
when you create an initial draft of a model, you might not have given a
lot of thought as to the final name (for example, you might have named
it ``AlexWilburModel1''). As you come closer to finalizing the model and
putting it to use, you realize that a more proper name would be
``Contract Renewals,'' and you want to rename it.

Another example is when your organization makes a decision to refer to a
process or document type by a different name. For example, after you
create your model and are ready to apply it, your organization might
mandate that all ``Contracts'' will now formally be referred to as
``Agreements.'' If needed, you can choose to rename your model from
``Contract Renewals'' to ``Agreement Renewals.''

[!IMPORTANT] You can only rename a model if it has not been applied to a
document library.

Renaming a model also renames the

type] that is associated with the model.
