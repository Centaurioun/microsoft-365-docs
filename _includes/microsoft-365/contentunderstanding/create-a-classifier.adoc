== Create a classifier in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing

Follow the instructions in link:create-syntex-model.md[Create a model in
Syntex] to create an unstructured document processing model in a content
center. Or, follow the instructions in link:create-local-model.md[Create
a model on a local SharePoint site] to create the model on a local site.
Then start with this article to begin training your model.

A classifier is a type of model that you can use to automate
identification and classification of a document type. For example, you
might want to identify all _Contract Renewal_ documents that are added
to your document library, such as is shown in the following
illustration.

image::../media/content-understanding/contract-renewal.png[Contract
Renewal document.]

Creating a classifier enables you to create a new
link:/sharepoint/governance/content-type-and-workflow-planning#content-type-overview[SharePoint
content type] that will be associated to the model.

When creating the classifier, you need to create _explanations_ to
define the model. This enables you to note common data that you would
expect to consistently find this document type.

Use examples of the document type (``example files'') to ``train'' your
model to identify files that have the same content type.

To create a classifier, you need to: 1. Name your model. 2. Add your
example files. 3. Label your example files. 4. Create an explanation. 5.
Test your model.

____
[!NOTE] While your model uses a classifier to identify and classify
document types, you can also choose to pull specific pieces of
information from each file identified by the model. Do this by creating
an *extractor* to add to your model. See
link:create-an-extractor.md[Create an extractor].
____

=== Name your model

The first step to create your model is to give it a name:

[arabic]
. From the content center, select *New*, and then *Model*.
. On the *Options for model creation* page, select *Teaching method*.
. On the *Teaching method: Details* page, select *Next*.
. On the *Create a model with the teaching method* page, in the *Model
name* field, type the name of the model. For example, if you want to
identify contract renewal documents, you could name the model _Contract
Renewal_.
. Choose *Create*. This creates a home page for the model.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/model-home.png[Classifier model
home page.]

When you create a model, you are also creating a new site content type.
A content type represents a category of documents that have common
characteristics and share a collection of columns or metadata properties
for that particular content. SharePoint content types are managed
through the
https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-or-customize-a-site-content-type-27eb6551-9867-4201-a819-620c5658a60f[Content
types gallery]. For this example, when you create the model, you are
creating a new _Contract Renewal_ content type.

Select *Advanced settings* if you want to map this model to an existing
enterprise content type in the SharePoint Content type gallery to use
its schema. Enterprise content types are stored in the Content Type Hub
in the SharePoint admin center and are syndicated to all sites in the
tenant. Note that while you can use an existing content type to leverage
its schema to help with identification and classification, you still
need to train your model to extract information from files it
identifies.

settings.]

=== Add your example files

On the model home page, add your examples files you will need to help
train the model to identify your document type.

____
[!NOTE] You should use the same files for both classifier and
link:create-an-extractor.md[extractor training]. You always have the
option to add more later, but typically you add a full set of example
files. Label some to train your model, and test the remaining unlabeled
ones to evaluate model fitness.
____

For your training set, you want to use both positive and negative
examples: - Positive example: Documents that represent the document
type. These contain strings and information that would always be in this
type of document. - Negative example: Any other document that does not
represent the document you want to classify.

Be sure to use at least five positive examples and at least one negative
example to train your model. You want to create additional ones to test
your model after the training process.

To add example files:

[arabic]
. On the model home page, in the *Add example files* tile, click *Add
files*.
. On the *Select example files for your model* page, select your example
files from the Training files library in the content center. If you had
not already uploaded them there, choose to upload them now by clicking
*Upload* to copy them to the Training files library.
. After selecting your example files to use to train the model, click
*Add*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/select-sample.png[Select example
files.]

=== Label your example files

After adding your example files, you need to label them as either
positive or negative examples.

[arabic]
. From the model home page, on the *Classify files and run training*
tile, click *Train classifier*. This displays the label page that shows
a listing of your example files, with the first file visible in the
viewer.
. In the viewer on the top of the first example file, you should see
text asking if the file is an example of the model you just created. If
it is a positive example, select *Yes*. If it is a negative example,
select *No*.
. From the *Labeled examples* list on the left, select additional files
that you want to use as examples, and label them.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/classifier-home-page.png[Classifier
home page.]

____
[!NOTE] Label at least five positive examples. You must also label at
least one negative example.
____

=== Create an explanation

The next step is for you to create an explanation on the Train page. An
explanation helps the model understand how to recognize the document.
For example, the Contract Renewal documents always contain a _Request
for additional disclosure_ text string.

____
[!Note] When used with extractors, an explanation identifies the string
that you want to extract from the document.
____

To create an explanation:

[arabic]
. From the model home page, select the *Train* tab to go to the Train
page.
. On the Train page, in the *Trained files* section you should see a
list of the sample files that you previously labeled. Select one of the
positive files from the list, and it displays in the viewer.
. In the Explanation section, select *New* and then *Blank*.
. On the *Create an explanation* page:
[loweralpha]
.. Type the *Name* (for example, ``Disclosure Block'').
.. Select the *Type*. For the sample, select *Phrase list*, since you
add a text string.
.. In the *Type here* box, type the string. For the sample, add
``Request for additional disclosure''. You can select *Case sensitive*
if the string needs to be case sensitive.
.. Click *Save*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/explanation.png[Create
explanation.]
. The content center now checks to see if the explanation you created is
complete enough to identify the remaining labeled example files
correctly, as positive and negative examples. In the *Trained files*
section, check the *Evaluation* column after the training has completed
to see the results. The files show a value of *Match*, if the
explanations you created was enough to match what you labeled as
positive or negative.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/match.png[Match value.]
+
If you receive a *Mismatch* on the labeled files, you might need to
create an additional explanation to provide the model more information
to identify the document type. If this happens, click on the file to get
more information about why the mismatch occurred.

Once you’ve trained an extractor, that trained extractor can be used as
an explanation. In the *Explanations* section, this is shown as a *Model
reference*.

image::../media/content-understanding/explanations-model-reference.png[Screenshot
of the Explanations section showing the type Model reference.]

=== Test your model

If you received a match on your labeled sample files, you can now test
your model on your remaining unlabeled example files that the model has
not seen before. This is optional, but a useful step to evaluate the
``fitness'' or readiness of the model before using it, by testing it on
files the model hasn’t seen before.

[arabic]
. From the model home page, select the *Test* tab. This runs the model
on your unlabeled sample files.
. In the *Test files* list, your example files display and shows if the
model predicted them to be positive or negative. Use this information to
help determine the effectiveness of your classifier in identifying your
documents.
