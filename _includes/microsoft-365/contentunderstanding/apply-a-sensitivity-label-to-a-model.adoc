== Apply a sensitivity label to a model in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ Unstructured document processing

You can easily apply a
link:../compliance/sensitivity-labels.md[sensitivity label] to
unstructured document processing models in Microsoft Syntex.

____
[!Note] Sensitivity labels are not yet available for prebuilt models or
for freeform or structured document processing models.
____

Sensitivity labels let you apply encryption to the documents that your
models identify. For example, you want your model to not only identify
any financial documents that contain bank account numbers or credit card
numbers that are uploaded to your document library, but also to apply a
sensitivity label that’s configured with encryption settings to restrict
who can access that content and how it can be used. Syntex models honor
the
link:../compliance/apply-sensitivity-label-automatically.md#how-multiple-conditions-are-evaluated-when-they-apply-to-more-than-one-label[label
order] rules and also don’t overwrite an existing label that was
manually applied by a user to the file.

You can apply a pre-existing sensitivity label to your model through
your model settings on your model’s home page. The label must already be
published to be available for selection from model settings. Labels
apply to Office files for Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), and Excel
(.xlsx).

____
[!Important] For sensitivity labels to be available to apply to your
models, they need to be
link:../admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-compliance.md[created and
published in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal].

=== Add a sensitivity label to a model

[arabic]
. From the model home page, select *Model settings*.

of the Models page with the Model settings option highlighted.]
. On *Model settings* pane, in the *Compliance* section, select the
*Sensitivity label* menu to see a list of sensitivity labels that are
available for you to apply to the model.

. Select the sensitivity label you want to apply to the model, and then
select *Save*.

After you apply the sensitivity label to your model, you can apply it to
a:

* New document library
* Document library to which the model is already applied

==== Apply the sensitivity label to a document library to which the model is already applied

If your model has already been applied to a document library, you can do
the following to sync your sensitivity label update to apply it to the
document library:

[arabic]
. On the model home page, in the *Libraries with this model* section,
select the document library to which you want to apply the sensitivity
label update.
. Select *Sync*.

showing Libraries with this model section with Sync highlighted.]

After you apply the update and sync it to your model, you can confirm
that it has been applied by doing the following steps:

[arabic]
. In the content center, in the *Libraries with this model* section,
select the library to which your updated model was applied.
. In your document library view, select the information icon to check
the model properties.
. In the *Active models* list, select your updated model.
. In the *Sensitivity label* section, you’ll see the name of the applied
sensitivity label.

On your model’s view page in your document library, a new *Sensitivity
label* column will display. As your model classifies files it identifies
as belonging to its content type and lists them in the library view, the
*Sensitivity label* column will also display the name of the sensitivity
label that has been applied to it through the model.

For example, all financial documents that your model identifies also
will have the _Encryption_ sensitivity label applied to them, preventing
them from being accessed by unauthorized people. If an attempt is made
to access the file from the document library by an unauthorized person,
an error will display saying it isn’t allowed because of the applied
sensitivity label.
