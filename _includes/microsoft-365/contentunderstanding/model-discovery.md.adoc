== Publish and discover models in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

You can make your trained document understanding models available for others to view and use directly from the SharePoint document library.

You can also find and evaluate trained models in other content centers that were created by others in your organization.
Select the model that is most useful for classifying your files or extracting specific information from them.

=== Make your model discoverable to others

To make your trained model available for others to use:

. On the *Models* page for your model, select *Model settings*.
. On the *Model settings* panel, in the *Sites where this model is available* section, select *Edit*.
. At this point, the *Select the sites where this model is available* panel will be different depending on whether or not you are an administrator.
+
If you are a SharePoint administrator, you will see this view.

 ** *Not available on any sites* -- The model won't be available for others to use.
 ** *All sites* -- The model will be available in the content type gallery for others to use.
 ** *Only selected sites* -- You can choose which site or sites in which the model will be available.
Click in the text box to search for and choose the sites to which you want the model applied.
You'll only see sites for which you have access.

If you are _not_ a SharePoint administrator, you will see this view.

You can only add or remove availability to the specific sites to which you already have access.

. Select the sites where you want the model to be available for other users to apply, and then select *Save*.

=== Discover other trained models

To find trained models that might be suitable for your content:

. In the document library for your model, select *Automate* > *View document understanding models*.
. On the *Review models and apply new ones* page, you can review the applied models and the models that are available to be applied to your document library.

Select *View model details* to see information about the model, such as description, extractors, and other settings.
 ** On the *Available* tab, see the trained models that are available to be applied to your library.

You can evaluate trained models against your content to help you find the most appropriate one.
To select a model that you want to apply to your library:
