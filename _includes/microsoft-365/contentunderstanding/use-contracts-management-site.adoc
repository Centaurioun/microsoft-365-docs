The contracts management site is a ready-to-deploy and customizable
SharePoint site template that helps your organization maximize the value
of Microsoft Syntex. The site is designed to let you create a
professional site to manage, process, and track the status of contracts
in your organization.

=== Features of the site

image::../media/content-understanding/contracts-management-site-home-page.png[Screenshot
of the contracts management site template home page.]

The contracts management site includes pre-populated pages, web parts,
and site navigation. The site can be customized to incorporate your
organization’s own branding, employee information, policy and planning
information, workflow, contacts, and resources.

The site uses the power of a Syntex model running on a SharePoint
document library to classify documents and extract metadata. The site
provides prebuilt document libraries to get you started quickly, but you
can also create your own as needed. The site includes the following
featured libraries:

* *Regions* – Classify contract documents by geographical area, country,
or region.
* *Templates* – Select the appropriate contract template for the type of
contract, such as non-disclosure agreements, service agreements, and
statements of work.
* *Contract requests* – Launch a contract request directly to your
contracts team.
* *Clients* – Find client information in one convenient location.
* *Models* – Use the model in this library to classify documents and
extract metadata. Users can create their own models to fit their needs
and add them to this library.
* *Sample contracts library* – Find files that were classified and have
had metadata extracted using the Syntex model.

There is a separate view in the library where you can track other
metadata such as status, and that uses document library formatting to
show it in a more visual way.

=== Provision the site

The contracts management site can be provisioned from the
https://lookbook.microsoft.com/[SharePoint look book service].
