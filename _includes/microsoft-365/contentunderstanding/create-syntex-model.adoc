== Create an enterprise model in Microsoft Syntex

*Applies to:*   ✓ All custom models   |   ✓ All prebuilt models

An enterprise model is created and trained in the
link:create-a-content-center.md[content center], and can be discovered
by others to use. Whether you want to create a custom model or use a
prebuilt model, you can do so from any of these places in Microsoft
Syntex:

* From the *Models* library
* From the link:create-a-content-center.md[content center] home page
* From any document library in a site where Syntex has been activated

For this article, we start in the *Models* library. For information
about the different model types, see
link:model-types-overview.md[Overview of model types in Syntex].

If you want to create a local model, see
link:create-local-model.md[Create a model on a local SharePoint site].

=== Create a model

From the *Models* library, select *Create a model*.

of the Models library showing the Create a model button.]

On the *Options for model creation* page, there are two sections:

* link:#train-a-custom-model[*Train a custom model*]
* link:#set-up-a-prebuilt-model[*Set up a prebuilt model*]

=== Train a custom model

The *Train a custom model* section shows the training method for the
type of custom models you want to create.
