[arabic]
. From a SharePoint document library, select *New* > *Create modern
template*.

. After you upload the document, the document is displayed in the
template studio where you can convert the document to a template by
adding fields.
+

. At the upper-left corner of the template studio, select the name for
the template. The default name is the name of the document used to
create the template. If you want to rename the template, select the
default name or the pencil icon next to the name, type the new name, and
then select *Enter*.

rename.]

=== Create and reuse fields

When you select a document to create a modern template, you can create a
new field and map it to multiple occurrences of the content with the
same field.

For example, the name of a contractor can occur multiple times in a
consulting agreement document. You can create a field named ``Contractor
Name'' and associate it with all occurrences of the name throughout the
document when you generate a modern template.

To create and reuse a field:

[arabic]
. Select a section of the content, and when it appears on the field
panel on the right, select *Confirm*. You can select as many occurrences
as required.
. When the field is created, select *Next* to associate the created
field with different data sources.
. When done, you can see the count of all selections in the field card
with the field name and the associated data source.

select a date*.

. In the *Type of info* field, select the data type you want to
associate with the field. Currently, there are six options available:
*Single line of text*, *Multiple lines of text*, *Number*, *Date and
time*, *Email*, and *Hyperlink*.
. Select *Add*.
+
____
[!NOTE] You can configure multiple date formatters such as MM/DD/YYYY,
DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD, and Month DD, including setting time in both
12-hour and 24-hour format.
____

==== Associate a field by selecting from choices in a column of a list or library

On the *New field* panel:

[arabic]
. In the *Name* field, enter a relevant name for the field.
. In the *How authors fill in this field* section, choose *Select from
choices in a column of a list or library*, and then choose *Select*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-create-template-6a.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing the New field panel for input from a
SharePoint list.]

image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-create-template-7.png[Screenshot
of the Select a list for adding a source column page showing lists.]

the column name you want to associate with the field, and then select
*Save*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-create-template-8.png[Screenshot

names.]
+
If you want to see the original page of lists again, select *Go to (list
name)* link at the bottom of the list.
. When you’re done, you’ll see that the list field has been associated
with the field.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-create-template-9.png[Screenshot
of the New field panel showing the list field associated with the
field.]
. If you want users to be able to add inputs manually, in addition to
choosing from a list, select *Allow authors to add new choices*. In this
case, the default for the manual input data type is _Single line of
text_. Also the values input by the authors will only be used to
generate the document. They won’t be added to the SharePoint list.

==== Associate a field by selecting from a managed metadata term set or term

On the *New field* panel:

[arabic]
. In the *Name* field, enter a relevant name for the field.
. In the *How authors fill in this field* section, choose *Select from
managed metadata term set or term*, and then choose *Select*.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-create-template-term.png[Screenshot

or term set.]
. On the *Select term sets or terms* page, search for or select the term
set or term to associate with the field, and then select *Save*.

. When you’re done, you’ll see that the selected term set or term has
been associated with the field.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associated-term.png[Screenshot
of the New field panel showing the associated term set or term.]
. If you want users to be able to add multiple values corresponding to
the term set or term, select *Allow multiple values*. Also, if the term
set is configured as an open term set, you can select *Allow new
values*. If you enable this option, users who generate documents from
the modern template can add new terms to the term set and add those
terms as field values.
+
____
[!TIP] When you enable the *Allow new values* option (only allowed for
open term sets), users are more likely to add redundant terms in the
term store. Redundant terms can make it difficult for admins to manage a
term set.
____

==== Associate a table with a SharePoint list or library

On the *New field* panel:

[arabic]
. In the *Name* field, enter a relevant name for the field.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associate-table-1.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing the New field for associating a table
field.]
. Select the table section in the document you want to create a field
for. You can view the table selection in the *Fields* section.
. Confirm the selection, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Select a list for adding a source column* page, associate a
SharePoint list or library to the table.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associate-table-2.png[Screenshot
of the Select a list for adding a source column page.]
. Once the list is selected, map the list columns to the table columns.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associate-table-3.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing how to map the list columns to the table
columns.]
+
The associated list column names that match with the table header
columns will be filled in automatically, which you can then modify.
. Next, map all the table columns to the list columns.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associate-table-4.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing how to map all the table columns with the
list columns.]
. When all the table columns are mapped, you can see the table selection
in the *Fields* section.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-associate-table-5.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing the table selection in the New field
panel.]

When users generate documents from the template, they can select
relevant list entries to be filled in, and the table rows will increase
or decrease based on the number of row selections made.

==== Add an image field

On the *New field* panel:

[arabic]
. In the *Name* field, enter a relevant name for the field.
+
image::../media/content-understanding/content-assembly-add-image-field.png[Screenshot
of the template viewer showing the New field for adding an image field.]
. Select the image section in the document you want to create a field
for. You can view the image name and the alt text (a description of the
image) for the selected image in the *Fields* section.
. Confirm the selection, and then select *Next*.
. You can choose to allow authors who will fill in the field to either
upload images from any source—OneDrive or SharePoint or from local
storage—or restrict the entries by associating it to an image column in
a SharePoint list.
. You can choose to control how the image selected by the author will be
filled in the document. If you select the *Resize* checkbox, then the
uploaded image will be scaled to the dimensions of the image selected
for templatization. If not selected, then the image dimension of the
image uploaded by the author will be persisted.
+
____
[!TIP] When you enable the *Resize* option, users are more likely to
have favorable results of the image dimensions in the template.
____

=== Save a modern template as a draft

You can create as many fields as you think are necessary. When you’re
done, you can choose to save the template as a draft.

[arabic]
. Select *Save draft* to save the template as a draft and you can access
it later.
. To view, edit, or publish saved drafts from the *Draft templates*
dropdown menu in the *Modern templates*, select *New* > *Edit New menu*
from the document library.

=== Publish a modern template

When you have completed adding all relevant fields to the template and
you want to make it available for use by other users in the document
library, you can publish the template.

[arabic]
. Select *Publish* to publish the template to be used by other users in
the organization to create documents.
. To view, edit, or unpublish _published_ templates from the *Published
templates* dropdown menu in the *Modern templates* section, select *New*
> *Edit New menu* from the document library.
