== Create a model on a local SharePoint site with Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

SharePoint Syntex now provides an option to create and train models locally on your own SharePoint site.
These models can be used only on the site where they're created.

By activating document classification and extraction on your SharePoint site, SharePoint Syntex lets you classify files in document libraries, extract information from new files, and automate activities based on extracted information.

When you activate local model creation, the following lists and libraries will be added to your site:

* Models document library
* Training files document library
* Explanation templates list
* Model usage list

This feature is available only for creating xref:apply-a-model.adoc[document understanding models] and xref:prebuilt-models.adoc[prebuilt models].
