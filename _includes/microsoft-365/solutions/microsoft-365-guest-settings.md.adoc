== Microsoft 365 guest sharing settings reference

This article provides a reference for the various settings that can affect sharing with people outside your organization for the Microsoft 365 workloads: Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, SharePoint, and OneDrive.
These settings are located in the Azure Active Directory, Microsoft 365, Teams, and SharePoint admin centers.

*Navigation:* https://admin.microsoft.com[Microsoft 365 admin center] > *Settings* > *Org settings* > Microsoft 365 Groups

=== SharePoint and OneDrive (organization-level)

*Admin role:* SharePoint administrator

These settings affect all of the sites in the organization.
They do not affect Microsoft 365 Groups or Teams directly, however we recommend that you align these settings with the settings for Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams to avoid user experience issues.
(For example, if guest sharing is allowed in Teams but not SharePoint, then guests in Teams will not have access to the Files tab because Teams files are stored in SharePoint.)

==== SharePoint and OneDrive sharing settings

Because OneDrive is a hierarchy of sites within SharePoint, the organization-level sharing settings directly affect OneDrive just as they do other SharePoint sites.

*Navigation:* SharePoint admin center > *Policies* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222[*Sharing*]

image::../media/sharepoint-organization-external-sharing-controls.png[Screenshot of SharePoint organization-level sharing settings.]

|===
| Setting | Default | Description

| SharePoint
| Anyone
| Specifies the most permissive sharing permissions allowed for SharePoint sites.

| OneDrive
| Anyone
| Specifies the most permissive sharing permissions allowed for OneDrive sites.
This setting cannot be more permissive than the SharePoint setting.
|===

==== SharePoint and OneDrive advanced sharing settings

*Navigation:* SharePoint admin center > *Policies* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222[*Sharing*]

image::../media/external-sharing.png[Screenshot of SharePoint organization-level additional sharing settings.]

|===
| Setting | Default | Description

| Limit external sharing by domain
| Off
| This setting allows you to specify a list of allowed or blocked domains for sharing.
When allowed domains are specified, then sharing invitations can only be sent to those domains.
When denied domains are specified, then sharing invitations cannot be sent to those domains.
<p> This setting affects all SharePoint and OneDrive sites in the organization.

| Allow only users in specific security groups to share externally
| Off
| If you want to limit who can share with guests in SharePoint and OneDrive, you can do so by limiting sharing to people in specified security groups.
These settings do not affect sharing via Microsoft 365 Groups or Teams.
Guests invited via a group or team would also have access to the associated site, though document and folder sharing could only be done by people in the specified security groups.
<p> For each specified group, you can choose which of those users can share with Anyone links.

| Guests must sign in using the same account to which sharing invitations are sent
| Off
| Prevents guests from redeeming site sharing invitations using a different email address than the invitation was sent to.
<p> link:/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration-preview[SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B (Preview)] does not use this setting because all guests are added to the directory based on the email address that the invitation was sent to.
Alternate email addresses cannot be used to access the site.

| Allow guests to share items they don't own
| On
| When *On*, guests can share items that they don't own with other users or guests;
when *Off* they cannot.
Guests can always share items for which they have full control.

| People who use a verification code must reauthenticate after this many days
| Off
| This setting allows you to require that users authenticating with a one-time passcode need to reauthenticate after a certain number of days.

| Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days
| On
| If your administrator has set an expiration time for guest access, each guest that you invite to the site or with whom you share individual files and folders will be given access for a certain number of days.
For more information visit, https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-guest-expiration-for-a-site-25bee24f-42ad-4ee8-8402-4186eed74dea[Manage guest expiration for a site]
|===

==== SharePoint and OneDrive file and folder link settings

When files and folders are shared in SharePoint and OneDrive, sharing recipients are sent a link with permissions to the file or folder rather than being granted direct access to the file or folder themselves.
Several types of links are available, and you can choose the default link type presented to users when they share a file or folder.
You can also set permissions and expiration options for _Anyone_ links.

*Navigation:* SharePoint admin center > *Policies* > https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222[*Sharing*]

image::../media/sharepoint-organization-files-folders-sharing-settings.png[Screenshot of SharePoint organization-level files and folders sharing settings.]

|===
| Setting | Default | Description

| File and folder links
| Anyone with the link
| Specifies which sharing link is shown by default when a user shares a file or folder.
Users can change the option before sharing if they want.
If the default is set to *Anyone with the link* and _Anyone_ sharing is not allowed for a given site, then *Only people in your organization* will be shown as the default for that site.

| These links must expire within this many days
| Off (no expiration)
| Specifies the number of days after an _Anyone_ link is created that it expires.
Expired links cannot be renewed.
Create a new link if you need to continue sharing past the expiration.

| File permissions
| View and edit
| Specifies the file permission levels available to users when creating an _Anyone_ link.
If *View* is selected, then users can only create _Anyone_ file links with view permissions.
If *View, and edit* is selected, then users can choose between view and view and edit permissions when they create the link.

| Folder permissions
| View, edit, and upload
| Specifies the folder permission levels available to users when creating an _Anyone_ link.
If *View* is selected, then users can only create _Anyone_ folder links with view permissions.
If *View, edit, and upload* is selected, then users can choose between view and view, edit, and upload permissions when they creat the link.
|===

=== SharePoint (site level)

*Admin role:* SharePoint administrator

Because these settings are subject to the organization-wide settings for SharePoint, the effective sharing setting for the site may change if the organization-level setting changes.
If you choose a setting here and the organization-level is later set to a more restrictive value, then this site will operate at that more restrictive value.
For example, if you choose *Anyone* and the organization-level setting is later set to *New and existing guests*, then this site will only allow new and existing guests.
If the organization-level setting is then set back to *Anyone*, this site would again allow _Anyone_ links.

==== Site sharing

You can set guest sharing permissions for each site in SharePoint.
This setting applies to both site sharing and file and folder sharing.
(_Anyone_ sharing is not available for site sharing.
If you choose *Anyone*, users will be able to share files and folders by using _Anyone_ links, and the site itself with new and existing guests.)

If the site has a sensitivity label applied, that label may control the external sharing settings.
For more information, see xref:../compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites.adoc[Use sensitivity labels to protect content in Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites].

____
[!NOTE] Sharing settings for channel sites can only be changed by using the link:/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite[Set-SPOSite] PowerShell cmdlet.

==== Site file and folder link settings

You can set defaults for link type and permissions, and expiration settings for _Anyone_ links for each site.
When set at the site level, these settings override the organization-level settings.
Note that if _Anyone_ links are disabled at the organization level, _Anyone_ will not be an available link type at the site level.
