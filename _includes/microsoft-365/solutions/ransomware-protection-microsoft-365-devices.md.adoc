== Step 4. Protect devices

To help protect devices (endpoints) against the initial access part of a ransomware attack:

* Deploy link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune[Intune] as a mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for your devices and enroll your organization-owned devices.
* Implement the link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies[Common identity and device access policies] to validate the user account credentials and enforce device health and compliance requirements.
* Enable link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection[Network Protection] in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft 365 Defender.
* Configure link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-available-settings[site and download checking] and link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-available-settings[app and file checking] in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block or warn.
* Enable link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-advanced-scan-types-microsoft-defender-antivirus[Microsoft Defender Antivirus scanning] of downloaded files and attachments.
* Set *Remote Desktop security level* to *TLS* in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft 365 Defender.

=== Windows 11 or 10 devices

To help protect against the lateral movement part of an attack from a Windows 11 or 10 device:

* https://support.microsoft.com/windows/turn-microsoft-defender-firewall-on-or-off-ec0844f7-aebd-0583-67fe-601ecf5d774f[Turn on Microsoft Defender Firewall].
* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus[Update Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions].

To reduce the impact of the attack:

* Use link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#use-advanced-protection-against-ransomware[attack surface reduction rules and advanced protection against ransomware].

To help protect against an attacker evading your security defenses:

* Keep link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus[cloud-delivered protection] in Microsoft Defender Antivirus turned on.
* Keep Microsoft Defender Antivirus link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus[real-time behavior monitoring] turned on.
* Turn on link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus[real-time protection].
* Turn on link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection[tamper protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint] to prevent malicious changes to security settings.

To help protect against an attacker executing code as part of an attack:

* Turn on link:/mem/intune/user-help/turn-on-defender-windows[Microsoft Defender Antivirus].
* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules#block-win32-api-calls-from-office-macros[Block Win32 API calls from Office macros].
* Migrate all legacy workbooks requiring Excel 4.0 macros to the updated VBA macro format using https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2010/02/16/migrating-excel-4-macros-to-vba/[this process].
* https://support.microsoft.com/topic/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6[Disable use of unsigned macros].
Ensure all internal macros with business need are signed and leveraging link:/deployoffice/security/designate-trusted-locations-for-files-in-office[trusted locations] to ensure unknown macros will not run in your environment.
* Stop malicious XLM or VBA macros by ensuring runtime macro scanning by https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/03/xlm-amsi-new-runtime-defense-against-excel-4-0-macro-malware/[Antimalware Scan Interface] (AMSI) is on.
This feature (enabled by default) is on if the Group Policy setting for *Macro Run Time Scan Scope* is set to *Enable for All Files* or *Enable for Low Trust Files*.
Get the latest group policy template files.

=== Impact on users and change management

As you implement these protections, perform change management for the following:

* The link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies[common Zero Trust identity and device access policies] can deny access to users who have non-compliant devices.
* Downloading files might warn users before the download or it might be blocked.
* Some Office, Excel 4.0, XLM, or VBA macros might no longer run.
