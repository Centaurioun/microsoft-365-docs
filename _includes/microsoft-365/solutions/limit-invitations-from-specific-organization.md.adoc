== Limit who can be invited by an organization

If you collaborate with another organization and want to limit who can be invited to that organization as a guest or a shared channel member in Teams, you can specify who can be invited in the cross-tenant access settings in Azure Active Directory.

____
[!NOTE] Changes to cross-tenant access settings may take six hours to take effect.
____

=== Create a security group

The easiest way to specify who can be invited to another organization is to use a security group.
You can use a security group with a defined membership or a dynamic security group.
You can use an existing security group or create a new one for this purpose.

To create a security group

. Sign in to https://aad.portal.azure.com[Azure Active Directory] using a Global administrator or Security administrator account.
. On the *Active Directory* page, select *Groups* and then select *New group*.
. Choose *Security* for the *Group type*.
. Type a *Group name.*
. Optionally, add a description for the group.
. For *Azure AD roles can be assigned to the group*, choose *No*.
. Select a pre-defined *Membership type (required)*.
. Add group owners and members or a link:/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership[dynamic query] if you're using dynamic user membership.
. Select *Create*.
Your group is created and ready for you to add members.

=== Add an organization

To define collaboration rules with another organization, you have to add that organization to the Azure AD cross-tenant access settings.
If you haven't already added the organization, follow this procedure to add it.

To add an organization

. In https://aad.portal.azure.com[Azure Active Directory], select *External Identities*, and then select *Cross-tenant access settings (preview)*.1.
Select *Organizational settings*.
. Select *Add organization*.
. On the *Add organization* pane, type the full domain name (or tenant ID) for the organization.
. Select the organization in the search results, and then select *Add*.
. The organization appears in the *Organizational settings* list.
At this point, all access settings for this organization are inherited from your default settings.

=== Choose who can be invited by an organization

There are two options for limiting who can be invited to an organization:

* Limit who can be invited as a guest.
This prevents users from being added to the other organization's Azure AD as a guest.
It prevents sharing of files, folders, sites, teams, and Microsoft 365 groups with people who aren't in the security group.
* Limit who can be added to an external shared channel.
This prevents people who aren't in the security group from being added to shared channels in the other organization.

In https://aad.portal.azure.com[Azure Active Directory], select *External Identities*, and then select *Cross-tenant access settings (preview)*.

To limit who can be invited as a guest

. Select the outbound access link for the organization that you want to modify.
. On the *B2B collaboration* tab, choose *Customize settings*.
. Under *Access status*, choose *Allow access*.
. Under *Target*, choose *Select external users and groups*.
. Select the link to add users and groups.
. Search for and select the security group that you want to use.
. Choose *Select*.
. Select *Save* and close the *Outbound access settings* blade.

To limit who can be invited as a shared channel participant

. Select the outbound access link for the organization that you want to modify.
. On the *B2B direct connect* tab, choose *Customize settings*.
. Under *Access status*, choose *Allow access*.
. Under *Target*, choose *Select external users and groups*.
. Select the link to add users and groups.
. Search for and select the security group that you want to use.
. Choose *Select*.
. Select *Save* and close the *Outbound access settings* blade.
