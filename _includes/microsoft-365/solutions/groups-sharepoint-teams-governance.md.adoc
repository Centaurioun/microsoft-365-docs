== Settings interactions between Microsoft 365 Groups, Teams and SharePoint

Some settings for Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint in Microsoft 365, particularly related to sharing and group/team and SharePoint site creation, overlap with each other.
This article provides descriptions of these interactions and best practices for how to work with these settings.

=== The effects of SharePoint settings on groups and teams

|===
| SharePoint setting | Description | Effect on Microsoft 365 groups and Teams | Recommendation

| External sharing for organization and site
| Determines if sites, files, and folders can be shared with people outside the organization.
| If SharePoint, groups, and Teams settings don't match, guests in the team may be blocked from accessing the site, or unexpected external access may occur.
| When changing sharing settings, check Groups settings, Teams settings, and SharePoint site settings for group-connected team sites.
+  + See xref:./collaborate-as-team.adoc[Collaborate with guests in a team]

| Domain allow/block
| Allows or prevents content being shared with specified domains.
| Groups and Teams do not recognize SharePoint allowlists or blocklists.
Users from domains disallowed in SharePoint could gain access to SharePoint sites or content through a team.
| Manage domain allowlists or blocklists for Azure AD and SharePoint together.
Create an org-wide governance process for allowing and blocking domains.
+  + See link:/sharepoint/restricted-domains-sharing[SharePoint domain settings] and link:/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list[Azure AD domain settings]

| Allow only users in specific security groups to share externally
| Specifies security groups who can share SharePoint sites, folders, and files externally.
| This setting does not prevent team owners from sharing teams externally.
Team guests have access to the associated SharePoint site.
|

| SharePoint site sharing settings
| Determines who can share the site directly outside of team membership.
This is configured by the team or site owner.
| This setting does not affect the team directly, but it can allow users to be added to a site and not have access to the team itself or other Teams resources
| Consider using this setting to limit sharing of the site directly and manage site access through the team.

| Let users create sites from the SharePoint start page and OneDrive
| Specifies if users can create new SharePoint sites.
| If this setting is turned off, users can still create group-connected team sites by creating a team.

=== The effects of groups settings on teams

|===
| Microsoft 365 groups setting | Description | Effect on Teams | Recommendation

| Naming policies
| Specifies group name prefixes and suffixes, and blocked words for group creation
| Policies are enforced for users creating teams.
|

| Group guest access
| Specifies if people outside the organization can be added to groups.
| If either the groups or Teams guest sharing settings are off, the team cannot be shared with guests.
| When changing guest sharing settings, check the settings for Teams, Groups, and the SharePoint site associated with the team.
+  + See xref:./collaborate-as-team.adoc[Collaborate with guests in a team]

| Group creation by security group
| Groups can only be created by members of a specific security group.
| Users who are not members of the security group will not be able to create a team.
| Be sure your process for requesting a group includes instructions for requesting a team or a SharePoint site.

| Group expiration policy
| Specifies a time period after which groups that are not actively used will be automatically deleted.
| When the group is deleted, the team and associated SharePoint site are also deleted.
Content protected by retention policies is retained.
| Use expiration policies to avoid sprawl of unused teams, groups and sites.
