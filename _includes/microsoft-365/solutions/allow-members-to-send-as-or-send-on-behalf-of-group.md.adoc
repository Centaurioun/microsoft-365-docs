== Allow members to send as or send on behalf of a group

A member of a Microsoft 365 group who has been granted *Send as* or *Send on behalf* permissions can send email as the group, or on behalf of the group.
(Guests in the group cannot be granted these permissions.)

This article explains how a global or Exchange administrator can set these permissions.

For example, if Megan Bowen is part of the *Training* Microsoft 365 group, and has *Send as* permissions on the group, if she sends an email as the group, it will look like the *Training* group sent the email.

The *Send on Behalf* permission lets a user send email on behalf of a Microsoft 365 group.
For example, if Alex Wilber is a part of the *Marketing* Microsoft 365 group, and has *Send on Behalf* permissions and sends an email as the group, the email looks like it was sent by *Alex Wilber on behalf of Marketing*.

____
[!IMPORTANT] You can configure *Send as* or *Send on behalf* for a given user, but not both.
If you configure both, it will default to *Send as*.
____

____
[!NOTE] *Send as* and *Send on behalf* are not supported on Outlook for Mac in hybrid Exchange configurations.
