== Understanding malware & other threats

Malware is a term used to describe malicious applications and code that
can cause damage and disrupt normal use of devices. Malware can allow
unauthorized access, use system resources, steal passwords, lock you out
of your computer and ask for ransom, and more.

Cybercriminals that distribute malware are often motivated by money and
will use infected computers to launch attacks, obtain banking
credentials, collect information that can be sold, sell access to
computing resources, or extort payment from victims.

As criminals become more sophisticated with their attacks, Microsoft is
here to help. Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows yet and
includes many features to help protect you whether youâ€™re at home, at
work, or on the go. With
