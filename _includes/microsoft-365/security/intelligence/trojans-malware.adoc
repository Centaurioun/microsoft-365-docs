== Trojans

Trojans are a common type of malware, which, unlike viruses, can’t
spread on their own. This means they either have to be downloaded
manually or another malware needs to download and install them.

Trojans often use the same file names as real and legitimate apps. It’s
easy to accidentally download a trojan thinking that it’s a legitimate
app.

=== How trojans work

Trojans can come in many different varieties, but generally they do the
following tasks:

* Download and install other malware, such as viruses or

* Record keystrokes and websites visited.
* Send information about the infected device to a malicious hacker
including passwords, sign in details for websites, and browsing history.
* Give a malicious hacker control over the infected device.
