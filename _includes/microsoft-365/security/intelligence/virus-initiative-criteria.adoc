The Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) helps organizations develop
better-together security solutions that are performant, reliable, and
aligned with Microsoft technology and strategy.

[!NOTE] The MVI Program is not currently accepting new applications for
membership. Please contact MVI@microsoft.com for more information.
____

You can request membership if you’re a representative for an
organization that develops and produces antimalware or antivirus
technology.

To qualify for the MVI program, your organization must meet all the
following requirements:

[arabic]
. Your security solution either replaces or compliments Microsoft
Defender Antivirus.
. Your organization is responsible for both developing and distributing
app updates to end-customers that address compatibility with Windows.
. Your organization must be active in the antimalware industry and have
a positive reputation, as evidenced by participation in industry
conferences or being reviewed in an industry-standard report such as
AV-Comparatives, OPSWAT, or Gartner.
. Your organization must sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with
Microsoft.
. Your organization must sign a program license agreement. Maintaining
this license agreement requires that you adhere to all program
requirements for antimalware apps. These requirements define the
behavior of antimalware apps necessary to ensure proper interaction with
Windows.
. You must submit your app to Microsoft for periodic performance testing
and feature review.
. Your solution must be certified through independent testing by at
least one industry-standard organization, and yearly certification must
be maintained.
