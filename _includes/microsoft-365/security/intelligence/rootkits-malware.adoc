== Rootkits

Malware authors use rootkits to hide malware on your device, allowing
malware to persist as long as possible. A successful rootkit can
potentially remain in place for years if it’s undetected. During this
time, it will steal information and resources.

=== How rootkits work

Rootkits intercept and change standard operating system processes. After
a rootkit infects a device, you can’t trust any information that device
reports about itself.

If asked a device to list all of the programs that are running, the
rootkit might stealthily remove any programs it doesn’t want you to know
about. Rootkits are all about hiding things. They want to hide both
themselves and their malicious activity on a device.

Many modern malware families use rootkits to try to avoid detection and
removal, including:

=== How to protect against rootkits

Like any other type of malware, the best way to avoid rootkits is to
prevent it from being installed in the first place.

* Apply the latest updates to operating systems and apps.
* Educate your employees so they can be wary of suspicious websites and
emails.
* Back up important files regularly. Use the 3-2-1 rule. Keep three
backups of your data, on two different storage types, and at least one
backup offsite.

==== What if I think I have a rootkit on my device?

Microsoft security software includes many technologies designed
specifically to remove rootkits. If you think you have a rootkit, you
might need an extra tool that helps you boot to a known trusted
environment.

Defender Offline] can be launched from the Windows Security app and has
the latest antimalware updates from Microsoft. It’s designed to be used
on devices that aren’t working correctly because of a possible malware
infection.

https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/hardening-the-system-and-maintaining-integrity-with-windows-defender-system-guard/[System
Guard] in Windows 10 protects against rootkits and threats that affect
system integrity.

==== What if I can’t remove a rootkit?

If the problem persists, we strongly recommend reinstalling the
operating system and security software. Then restore your data from a
backup.
