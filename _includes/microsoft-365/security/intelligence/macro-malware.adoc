== Macro malware

Macros are a powerful way to automate common tasks in Microsoft Office
and can make people more productive. However, macro malware uses this
functionality to infect your device.

=== How macro malware works

Macro malware hides in Microsoft Office files and is delivered as email
attachments or inside ZIP files. These files use names that are intended
to entice or scare people into opening them. They often look like
invoices, receipts, legal documents, and more.

Macro malware was fairly common several years ago because macros ran
automatically whenever a document was opened. In recent versions of
Microsoft Office, macros are disabled by default. Now, malware authors
need to convince users to turn on macros so that their malware can run.
They try to scare users by showing fake warnings when a malicious
document is opened.

We’ve seen macro malware download threats from the following families:

=== How to protect against macro malware

* Make sure macros are disabled in your Microsoft Office applications.
In enterprises, IT admins set the default setting for macros:
