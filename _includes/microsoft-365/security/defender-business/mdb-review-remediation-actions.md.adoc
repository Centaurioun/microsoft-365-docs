== Review remediation actions in the Action center

As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play.
Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval.
Examples of remediation actions include:

* Send a file to quarantine
* Stop a process from running
* Remove a scheduled task

All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.
