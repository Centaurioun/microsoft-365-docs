== Add users and assign licenses in Microsoft Defender for Business

As soon as you have signed up for Defender for Business, your first step
is to add users and assign licenses. This article describes how to add
users and includes next steps.

=== Add users and assign licenses

____
[!IMPORTANT] You must be a global administrator to perform this task.
The person who signed up your company for Microsoft 365 or for Defender
for Business is a global administrator by default.
____

[arabic]
. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at https://admin.microsoft.com
and sign in.
. Go to *Users* > *Active users*, and then select *Add a user*.
. In the *Set up the basics* pane, fill in the basic user information,
and then select *Next*.
* *Name*: Fill in the first and last name, display name, and username.
* *Domain* Choose the domain for the user’s account. For example, if the
user’s username is `Pat`, and the domain is `contoso.com`, they’ll sign
in by using `pat@contoso.com`.
* *Password settings*: Choose whether to use the autogenerated password
or to create your own strong password for the user. The user must change
their password after 90 days. Or you can choose the option to *Require
this user to change their password when they first sign in*. You can
also choose whether you want to send the user’s password in email when
the user is added.
. On the *Assign product licenses* page, select Defender for Business
(or Microsoft 365 Business Premium). Then choose *Next*.

If you don’t have any licenses available, you can still add a user and
buy additional licenses. For more information about adding users, see
link:../../admin/add-users/add-users.md[Add users and assign licenses at
the same time].
. On the *Optional settings* page, you can expand *Profile info* and
fill in details, such as the user’s job title, department, location, and
so forth. Then choose *Next*.
. On the *Review and finish* page, review the details, and then select
*Finish adding* to add the user. If you need to make any changes, choose
*Back* to go back to a previous page.
