== Understand next-generation configuration settings in Microsoft Defender for Business

Next-generation protection in Defender for Business includes robust antivirus and antimalware protection.
The default policies are designed to protect your devices and users without hindering productivity.
You can also customize the policies to suit your business needs.
And, if you're using Microsoft Intune, you can use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to manage your security policies.

=== Next-generation protection settings and options

The following table lists settings and options.

|===
| Setting | Description

| *Real-time protection*
|

| *Turn on real-time protection*
| Enabled by default, real-time protection locates and stops malware from running on devices.
_We recommend keeping real-time protection turned on._ When real-time protection is turned on, it configures the following settings:<ul><li>Behavior monitoring is turned on (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowbehaviormonitoring[AllowBehaviorMonitoring]).</li><li>All downloaded files and attachments are scanned (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowioavprotection[AllowIOAVProtection]).</li><li>Scripts that are used in Microsoft browsers are scanned (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowscriptscanning[AllowScriptScanning]).</li></ul>

| *Block at first sight*
| Enabled by default, block at first sight blocks malware within seconds of detection, increases the time (in seconds) allowed to submit sample files for analysis, and sets your detection level to High.
_We recommend keeping block at first sight turned on._ +  + When block at first sight is turned on, it configures the following settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus:<ul><li>Blocking and scanning of suspicious files is set to the High blocking level (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudblocklevel[CloudBlockLevel]).</li><li>The number of seconds for a file to be blocked and checked is set to 50 seconds (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudextendedtimeout[CloudExtendedTimeout]).</li></ul> + *Important* If block at first sight is turned off, it affects `CloudBlockLevel` and `CloudExtendedTimeout` for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

| *Turn on network protection*
| When turned on, network protection helps protect against phishing scams, exploit-hosting sites, and malicious content on the internet.
It also prevents users from turning network protection off.
+  + Network protection can be set to the following modes:<ul><li>**Block mode** is the default setting.
It prevents users from visiting sites that are considered unsafe.
_We recommend keeping network protection set to Block mode._</li><li>**Audit mode** allows users to visit sites that might be unsafe and tracks network activity to/from such sites.</li><li>**Disabled mode** neither blocks users from visiting sites that might be unsafe nor tracks network activity to/from such sites.</li></ul>

| *Remediation*
|

| *Action to take on potentially unwanted apps (PUA)*
| PUA can include advertising software;
bundling software that offers to install other, unsigned software;
and evasion software that attempts to evade security features.
Although PUA isn't necessarily a virus, malware, or other type of threat, it can affect device performance.
PUA protection blocks items that are detected as PUA.
You can set PUA protection to the following:<ul><li>**Enabled** is the default setting.
It blocks items detected as PUA on devices.
_We recommend keeping PUA protection enabled._</li><li>**Audit mode** takes no action on items detected as PUA.</li><li>**Disabled** doesn't detect or take action on items that might be PUA.</li></ul>

| *Scan*
|

| *Scheduled scan type*
| Consider running a weekly antivirus scan on your devices.
You can choose from the following scan type options:<ul><li>**Quickscan** checks locations, such as registry keys and startup folders, where malware could be registered to start along with a device.
_We recommend using the quickscan option._</li><li>**Fullscan** checks all files and folders on a device.</li><li>**Disabled** means no scheduled scans will take place.
Users can still run scans on their own devices.
(In general, we don't recommend disabling scheduled scans.)</li></ul> + xref:../defender-endpoint/schedule-antivirus-scans.adoc[Learn more about scan types].

| *Day of week to run a scheduled scan*
| Select a day for your regular, weekly antivirus scans to run.

| *Time of day to run a scheduled scan*
| Select a time to run your regularly scheduled antivirus scans to run.

| *Use low performance*
| This setting is turned off by default.
_We recommend keeping this setting turned off._ However, you can turn on this setting to limit the device memory and resources that are used during scheduled scans.
*Important* If you turn on *Use low performance*, it configures the following settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus:<ul><li>Archive files aren't scanned (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowarchivescanning[AllowArchiveScanning]).</li><li>Scans are assigned a low CPU priority (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-enablelowcpupriority[EnableLowCPUPriority]).</li><li>If a full antivirus scan is missed, no catch-up scan will run (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-disablecatchupfullscan[DisableCatchupFullScan]).</li><li>If a quick antivirus scan is missed, no catch-up scan will run (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-disablecatchupquickscan[DisableCatchupQuickScan]).</li><li>Reduces the average CPU load factor during an antivirus scan from 50 percent to 20 percent (link:/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-avgcpuloadfactor[AvgCPULoadFactor]).</li></ul>

| *User experience*
|

| *Allow users to access the Windows Security app*
| Turn on this setting to enable users to open the Windows Security app on their devices.
Users won't be able to override settings that you configure in Defender for Business, but they'll be able to run a quick scan or view any detected threats.

| *Antivirus exclusions*
| Exclusions are processes, files, or folders that are skipped by Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans.
_In general, you shouldn't need to define exclusions._ Microsoft Defender Antivirus includes many automatic exclusions that are based on known operating system behavior and typical management files.
xref:../defender-endpoint/configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Learn more about exclusions].

| *Process exclusions*
| Process exclusions prevent files that are opened by specific processes from being scanned by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
xref:../defender-endpoint/configure-process-opened-file-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Learn more about process exclusions].

| *File extension exclusions*
| File extension exclusions prevent files with specific extensions from being scanned by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
xref:../defender-endpoint/configure-extension-file-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Learn more about file extension exclusions].

| *File and folder exclusions*
| File and folder exclusions prevent files that are in specific folders from being scanned by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
