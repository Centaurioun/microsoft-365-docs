== Offboard a device from Microsoft Defender for Business

As devices are replaced or retired, or your business needs change, you
can offboard devices from Defender for Business. Offboarding a device
causes the device to stop sending data to Defender for Business.
However, data received prior to offboarding is retained for up to six
(6) months.

____
[!IMPORTANT] The procedures in this article describe how to remove a
device from monitoring by Defender for Business. If you’re using
Microsoft Intune to manage devices, and you prefer to remove the device
from Intune, see link:/mem/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe[Remove
devices by using wipe&#44; retire&#44; or manually unenrolling the device].
