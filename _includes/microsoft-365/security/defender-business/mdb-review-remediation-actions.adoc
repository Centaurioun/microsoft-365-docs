== Review remediation actions in the Action center

As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play. Depending
on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured,
remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval.
Examples of remediation actions include stopping a process from running
or removing a scheduled task.

All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.
