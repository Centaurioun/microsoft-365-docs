[!TIP] Defender for Business is designed to help you address detected
threats by offering up recommended actions. When you view an alert, look
for the recommended actions to take. Also take note of the alert
severity, which is determined not only on the basis of the threat
severity, but also on the level of risk to your company.

=== Alert severity

When Microsoft Defender Antivirus assigns an alert severity based on the
absolute severity of a detected threat (malware) and the potential risk
to an individual endpoint (if infected). Defender for Business assigns
an alert severity based on the severity of the detected behavior, the
actual risk to an endpoint (device), and more importantly, the potential
risk to your company. The following table lists a few examples:

|===
|Scenario |Alert severity and reason
|Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects and stops a threat before it does
any damage. |*Informational*. The threat was stopped before any damage
was done.

|Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects malware that was executing within
your company. The malware is stopped and remediated. |*Low*. Although
some damage might have been done to an individual endpoint, the malware
now poses no threat to your company.

|Malware that is executing is detected by Defender for Business. The
malware is blocked almost immediately. |*Medium* or *High*. The malware
poses a threat to individual endpoints and to your company.

|Suspicious behavior is detected but no remediation actions are taken
yet. |*Low*, *Medium*, or *High*. The severity depends on the degree to
which the behavior poses a threat to your company.
