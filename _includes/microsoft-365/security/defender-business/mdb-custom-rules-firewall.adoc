== Manage your custom rules for firewall policies in Microsoft Defender for Business

Defender for Business includes firewall policies that help protect your
devices from unwanted network traffic. You can use custom rules to
define exceptions for your firewall policies. That is, you can use
custom rules to block or allow specific connections.

To learn more about firewall policies and settings, see
link:mdb-firewall.md[Firewall in Defender for Business].
