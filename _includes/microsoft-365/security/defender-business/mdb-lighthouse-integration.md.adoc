== Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and Microsoft Defender for Business

=== Microsoft Defender for Business integrates with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

If you're a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and you have xref:../../lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview.adoc[Microsoft 365 Lighthouse], you can manage security for your customers (small and medium-sized businesses).
Microsoft Defender for Business is designed to integrate with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, so that you can view security incidents across tenants in your Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal (https://lighthouse.microsoft.com).
