Defender for Business is constantly being updated to include new feature
enhancements and capabilities.

Learn about new features in Defender for Business preview releases, and
be among the first to try upcoming features by turning on the preview
experience.

=== What you need to know

When working with features in public preview, these features:

* Might have restricted or limited functionality. For example, the
feature might only apply to one platform.
* Typically go through feature changes before they’re generally
available (GA).
* Are fully supported by Microsoft.
* Might only be available in selected geographic regions or cloud
environments. For example, a preview feature might not exist in the
government cloud.
* Individual features in preview might have more usage and support
restrictions. If so, this information is typically noted in the feature
documentation.
* The preview versions are provided with a standard support level, and
can be used for production environments.

=== Turn on preview features

If you turn on preview features, you’ll have access to upcoming
features, enabling you to provide feedback and help improve the overall
experience before these features are generally available.
