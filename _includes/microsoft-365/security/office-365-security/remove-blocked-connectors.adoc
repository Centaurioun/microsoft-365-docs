If an inbound connector is detected as potentially compromised, it is
restricted from sending any relaying email. The connector is then added
to the *Restricted entities* page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
When the connector is used to send email, the message is returned in a
non-delivery report (also known as an NDR or bounced message) with the
error code 550;5.7.711 and the following text:

____
Your message couldn’t be delivered. The most common reason for this is
that your organization’s email connector is suspected of sending spam or
phish and it’s no longer allowed to send email. Contact your email admin
for assistance. Remote Server returned `550;5.7.711 Access denied, bad
inbound connector. AS(2204).'
____

Admins can remove connectors from the Restricted entities page in
Microsoft 365 Defender or in Exchange Online PowerShell.

email because either it has been potentially compromised, or it has
exceeded sending limit.

There are 2 types of restricted entities:

* *Restricted user*: For more information about why a user can be
restricted and how to handle restricted users, see

and how to handle restricted connectors (this article).
