== Review and manage remediation actions in Office 365

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for
Office 365 plan 2]

As automated investigations on email & collaboration content result in
verdicts, such as _Malicious_ or _Suspicious_, certain remediation
actions are created. In Microsoft Defender for Office 365, remediation
actions can include:

* Soft deleting email messages or clusters
* Turning off external mail forwarding

These remediation actions are not taken unless and until your security
operations team approves them. We recommend reviewing and approving any
pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated
investigations complete in a timely manner. You need to be part of
Search & purge role before taking any actions.

We’ve added additional checks for duplicate or overlapping
investigations with the same clusters approved multiple times. If the
same investigation cluster is already approved in the previous hour, new
duplicate remediation will not be processed again. This behavior doesn’t
remove duplicate investigations or investigation evidence - it simply
de-duplicates approved actions to improve remediation processing speed.
For the duplicate approved cluster investigations, you won’t see action
details in the
https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history[action center] side
panel.
