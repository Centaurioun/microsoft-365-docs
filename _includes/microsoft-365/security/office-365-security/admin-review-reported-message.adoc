== Admin review for reported messages

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for
Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2] -
link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes and
Microsoft Defender for Office 365, admins can send templated messages
back to end users after they review reported messages. The templates can
be customized for your organization and based on your admin’s verdict as
well.

The feature is designed to give feedback to your users but doesn’t
change the verdicts of messages in the system. To help Microsoft update
and improve its filters, you need to submit messages for analysis using
link:submissions-admin.md[Admin submission].

You will only be able to mark and notify users of review results if the
message was reported as a
link:submissions-outlook-report-messages.md[false positives or false
negatives].

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com. To go directly to the *Submissions*
page, use https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission. To go
directly to the *User reported* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user.
* To modify the configuration for User reported messages, you need to be
a member of one of the following role groups:
** Organization Management or Security Administrator in the
link:mdo-portal-permissions.md[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
** Organization Management in
link:/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups[Exchange
Online].
* You’ll also need access to Exchange Online PowerShell. If the account
that you’re trying to use doesn’t have access to Exchange Online
PowerShell, you’ll receive an error that says _Specify an email address
in your domain_. For more information about enabling or disabling access
to Exchange Online PowerShell, see the following topics:
** link:/powershell/exchange/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell[Enable
or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell]
