The *Top domain mail flow status* insight in the
link:mail-flow-insights-v2.md[Mail flow dashboard] in the
https://protection.office.com[Security & Compliance Center] gives you
the current mail flow status for your organization.

This insight helps you identify and troubleshoot domains that are
experiencing *_mail flow_* issues. For example, the domain is unable to
receive external email because the domain has expired or the domain has
an incorrect MX record.

When you click *View details* in the widget, a *Domain status* flyout
appears that shows you more details for the status of each domain:

* *Domain*
* *Previous MX record*
* *Current MX record*
* *Email receiving status*
* *Domain status*: A green check mark indicates the current MX record
(at the time you clicked on the widget) matches the value we have on
record, and the domain has received email during the past two hours.
+
A red X indicates the MX record has been changed, and the domain has
received no email during the past 6 hours. This likely indicates that
your domain has expired, or that the MX record has been incorrectly
updated. Check with your domain registrar or DNS hosting service to see
if the domain has expired, or if the domainâ€™s MX record is incorrect.

You can click *View more* to see the same information for more domains.
