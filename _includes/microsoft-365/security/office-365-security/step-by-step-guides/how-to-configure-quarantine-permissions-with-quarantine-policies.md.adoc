____

=== What you will need

* Sufficient permissions (Security Administrator role)
* 5 minutes to perform the steps below.

=== Creating Custom quarantine policies with Request release flow

Our custom policies give admins the ability to decide what items their users can triage in the *_False positive_* folder with an extended ability of allowing the user to request the _release_ of those items from the folder.

. Decide what verdicts category (bulk, spam, phish, high confidence phish, or malware) of items you want your user to triage and not triage.
. For those categories that you don't want the users to triage, assign the items to the *AdminOnlyPolicy*.
As for the category you want users to triage with limited access, you can _create a custom policy_ with a request release access and assign users to that category.
. It's *strongly recommended* that malware and high confidence phish items be assigned to *AdminOnlyPolicy*, regular confidence phish items be assigned _limited access with request release_, while bulk and spam can be left as full access for users.

____

=== Assigning quarantine policies and enabling notification with organization branding

Once it has been decided the categories of items users can triage or not-triage, and created the corresponding quarantine policies, admins should to assign these policies to the respective users and enable notifications.

. Identify the users, groups, or domains that you would like to include in the _full access_ category vs.
the _limited access_ category, versus the _Admin-Only_ category.
. Sign in to the https://security.microsoft.com[Microsoft Security portal].
. Select *Email & collaboration* > *Policies & rules*.
. Select *Threat policies*.
. Select each of the following: *Anti-spam policies*, *Anti-phishing policy*, *Anti-Malware policy*.
. Select *Create policy* and choose *Inbound*.
. Add policy Name, users, groups, or domains to apply the policy to, and *Next*.
. In the *Actions* tab, select *Quarantine message* for categories.
You will notice an additional panel for _select quarantine policy_, use that dropdown to select the quarantine policy you created earlier.
. Move on to the *Review* section and click the *Confirm* button to create the new policy.
. Repeat these same steps for the other policies: *Anti-phishing policy*, *Anti-Malware policy*, and *Safe Attachment policy*.
