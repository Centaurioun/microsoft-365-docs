== Connect Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to Microsoft Sentinel

You can ingest your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 data (_and_ data
from the rest of the Microsoft 365 Defender suite), including incidents,
into Microsoft Sentinel.

Take advantage of rich security information events management (SIEM)
combined with data from other Microsoft 365 sources, synchronization of
incidents and alerts, and advanced hunting.
