== Set up steps for the Standard or Strict preset security policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Does Microsoft Defender for Office 365 gave you a way to apply security
policies that it would then maintain?

Did you know that when a best practice for a security control changes
due to the evolving threat landscape, or as new controls are added,
Microsoft _automatically_ updates security control settings for users
assigned to a _Standard_ or _Strict_ preset security policy?

By using preset security policies (_Standard_ or _Strict_), you will
always have Microsoft’s _recommended, best practice, configuration_ for
your users.

*Use the steps below* to apply preset security policies and have
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 manage and maintain security controls
_for you_.

=== What you will need

* Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or higher (Included in E5)
* Sufficient permissions (Security Administrator role)
* 5 minutes to perform the steps below.

=== Choose between Standard and Strict policies

Our Strict preset security policy has more aggressive limits and
settings for security controls that will result in more aggressive
detections and will involve the admin in making decisions on which
blocked emails are released to end users.

* Collect the list of your users that require more aggressive detections
even if it means more good mail will get flagged as suspicious. These
are typically your executive staff, executive support staff, and
historically highly targeted users.
* Ensure that the selected users have admin coverage to review and
release emails if the end user thinks that the mail might be good and
requests that the message be released to them.
* If the criteria above are met, then the user should be placed in the
Strict preset security policy. Otherwise the user should be placed in
the Standard preset security policy.

=== Your next step is Config Analyzer

Use config analyzer to determine if your users are configured per
Microsoft’s best practices.

____
[!TIP] Configuration analyzer allows admins to find and fix security
policies where the settings are below the Standard or Strict protection
profile settings in preset security policies. Find out more about
Configuration analyzer

____

Secure Presets are always recommended because it _ensures_ admins are
exercising Microsoft best practices. However, in some cases customized
configurations are required. Learn about custom policies
