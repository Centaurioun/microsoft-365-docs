== How to enable DMARC Reporting for Microsoft Online Email Routing Address (MOERA) and parked Domains

Best practice for domain email security protection is to protect
yourself from spoofing using Domain-based Message Authentication,
Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). If you haven’t already enabled DMARC
for your domains, that should be the first step, detailed here:
link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-dmarc-configure[Domain-based
Message Authentication&#44; Reporting&#44; and Conformance (DMARC)]

This guide is designed to help you configure DMARC for domains not
covered by the main DMARC article. These domains include domains that
you’re not using for email, but could be leveraged by attackers if they
remain unprotected:

* Your `onmicrosoft.com` domain, also known as the Microsoft Online
Email Routing Address (MOERA) domain.
* Parked custom domains that you’re currently not using for email yet.

=== What you’ll need

* Microsoft 365 admin center and access to your DNS provider hosting
your domains.
* Sufficient permissions as Global Admin to make the appropriate changes
in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
* 10 minutes to complete the steps in this article.

=== Activate DMARC for MOERA Domain

[arabic]
. Open the Microsoft 365 admin center at https://admin.microsoft.com.
. On the left-hand navigation, select *Show All*.
. Expand *Settings* and press *Domains*.
. Select your tenant domain (for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com).
. On the page that loads, select *DNS records*.
. Select *+ Add record*.
. A flyout will appear on the right. Ensure that the selected Type is
*TXT (Text)*.
. Add `_dmarc` as *TXT name*.
. Add your specific DMARC value.
. Press *Save*.

=== Active DMARC for parked domains

[arabic]
. Check if SPF is already configured for your parked domain. For
instructions, see
link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-spf-configure#how-to-handle-subdomains[Set
up SPF to help prevent spoofing - Office 365 | Microsoft Docs]
. Contact your DNS Domain provider.
. Ask to add this DMARC txt record with your appropriate email
addresses:
`v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:d@rua.contoso.com;ruf=mailto:d@ruf.contoso.com`.

=== Next Steps

Wait until the DNS changes are propagated and try to spoof the
configured domains. Check if the attempt is blocked based in the DMARC
record, and you receive a DMARC report.
