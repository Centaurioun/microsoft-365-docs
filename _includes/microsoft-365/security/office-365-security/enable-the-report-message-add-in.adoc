[!NOTE] If you’re an admin in a Microsoft 365 organization with Exchange
Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the *Submissions* page in
the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. For more information, see

The Report Message and Report Phishing add-ins for Outlook and Outlook
on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) makes it easy to report
false positives (good email marked as bad) or false negatives (bad email
allowed) to Microsoft and its affiliates for analysis.

Microsoft uses these submissions to improve the effectiveness of email
protection technologies. For example, suppose that people are reporting
many messages using the Report Phishing add-in. This information
surfaces in the Security Dashboard and other reports. Your
organization’s security team can use this information as an indication
that anti-phishing policies might need to be updated.

You can install either the Report Message or the Report Phishing add-in.
If you want your users to report both spam and phishing messages, deploy
the Report Message add-in in your organization.

The Report Message add-in provides the option to report both spam and
phishing messages. Admins can enable the Report Message add-in for the
organization, and individual users can install it for themselves.

The Report Phishing add-in provides the option to report only phishing
messages. Admins can enable the Report Phishing add-in for the
organization, and individual users can install it for themselves.

If you’re an individual user, you can enable both the add-ins for
yourself.

If you’re a global administrator or an Exchange Online administrator,
and Exchange is configured to use OAuth authentication, you can enable
the Report Message add-in and the Report Phishing add-in for your
organization. Both add-ins are now available through
link:../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md[Centralized
Deployment].

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* Both the Report Message add-in and the Report Phishing add-in work
with most Microsoft 365 subscriptions and the following products:
** Outlook on the web
** Outlook 2013 SP1 or later
** Outlook 2016 for Mac
** Outlook included with Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise
** Outlook app for iOS and Android
* Both add-ins are not available for shared, group, or delegated
mailboxes (the add-ins will be greyed out).
* Both add-ins are not available for on-premises Exchange mailboxes.
* Your existing web browser should work with both the Report Message and
Report Phishing add-ins. But, if you notice the add-in isn’t available
or not working as expected, try a different browser.
* For organizational installs, the organization needs to be configured
to use OAuth authentication. For more information, see
link:../../admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins.md[Determine
if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization].
* Admins need to be a member of the Global admins role group. For more
information, see
link:permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md[Permissions in the
Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
* For more information on how to report a message using the Report
Message feature, see
link:report-false-positives-and-false-negatives.md[Report false
positives and false negatives in Outlook].
* Organizations that have a URL filtering or security solution (such as
a proxy and/or firewall) in place, must have ipagave.azurewebsites.net
and outlook.office.com endpoints allowed to be reached on HTTPS
protocol.
