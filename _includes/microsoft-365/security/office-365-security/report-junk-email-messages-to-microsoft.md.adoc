Wondering what to do with suspicious emails or files?
In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, _users_ and _admins_ have different ways to report a suspicious email message, URL, or email attachment to Microsoft.

In addition, Microsoft 365 organizations with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint admins also have several methods for reporting files.
