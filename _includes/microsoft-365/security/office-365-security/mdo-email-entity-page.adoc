Admins of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 E5, and Defender for Office
P1 and P2 have a 360-degree view of email using the *Email entity page*.
This go-to email page was created to enhance information delivered
throughout Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Defender.

See email details in the experiences below, including
link:#email-preview-and-download-for-cloud-mailboxes[previewing and
downloading the email], the email headers _with the option to copy_,
Detection details, Threats detected, Latest and Original delivery
locations, Delivery actions, and IDs like Alert ID, Network Message ID
and more.

=== How to get to the email entity page

Anywhere you find email details throughout the Microsoft Defender for
Office 365, the email entity details are available. This includes: -
Threat Explorer - Advanced Hunting - Alerts - Quarantine - Submissions -
Reporting - Action Center

One way to get to the email entity page is Threat Explorer, but the
steps remain the same from wherever you find email details. Navigate to
the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com,
*Email & collaboration* > *Explorer*. Or, to go directly to the
*Explorer* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorer.

[arabic]
. In *Explorer*, select the subject of an email you’re investigating.
. The email fly-out for that mail will open.
. You’ll see *Open email entity*.
. Select it for your email deep dive.

____
[!NOTE] The permissions needed to view and use this page are the same as
to view *Explorer*. The admin must be a member of Global admin or global
reader, or Security admin or Security Reader. For more information, see
link:mdo-portal-permissions.md[Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal].

=== How to read the email entity page

The structure is designed to be easy to read and navigate through at a
glance. Various tabs along the top of the page allow you to investigate
in more detail. Here’s how the layout works:

[arabic]
. The most required fields are on the left side of the fly-out. These
details are `sticky', meaning they’re anchored to the left no matter the
tab you navigate to in the rest of the fly-out.
+
:::image type=``content''
source=``../../media/email-entities-3-left-panel.png'' alt-text=``The
Graphic of the email entity page with the left side highlighted''
lightbox=``../../media/email-entities-3-left-panel.png'':::
. On the top-right corner are the actions that can be taken on an email.
Any actions that can be taken through *Explorer* will also be available
through email entity page.
+
:::image type=``content''
source=``../../media/email-entities-5-preview.png'' alt-text=``The
Graphic of the email entity page with the right side highlighted''
lightbox=``../../media/email-entities-5-preview.png'':::
. Deeper analysis can be done by sorting through the rest of the page.
Check the email detection details, email authentication status, and
header. This area should be looked on a case-by-case basis, but the info
in these tabs is available for any email.

authentication status''
lightbox=``../../media/email-entities-4-middle-panel.png'':::

==== How to use the email entity page tabs

The tabs along the top of the entity page will allow you to investigate
email efficiently.

[arabic]
. *Timeline*: The timeline view for an email (per *Explorer* timeline)
shows the original delivery to post-delivery events that happen on an
email. For emails that have no post-delivery actions, the view shows the
original delivery row in timeline view. Events like: Zero-hour auto
purge (ZAP), Remediations, User and Admin submissions, Quarantine
information, URL clicks and more, from sources like: system, admin, and
user, show up here, in the order in which they occurred.
. *Analysis*: Analysis shows fields that help admins analyze an email in
depth. For cases where admins need to understand more about detection,
sender / recipient, and email authentication details, they should use
the Analysis tab. Links for Attachments and URLs are also found on this
page, under `Related Entities'. Both attachments and identified threats
are numbered here, and clicking will take you straight to the
Attachments and URL pages. This tab also has a View header option to
_show the email header_. Admins can compare any detail from email
headers, side by side with information on the main panel, for clarity.
. *Attachments*: This examines attachments found in the email with other
details found on attachments. The number of attachments shown is
currently limited to 10. Notice that detonation details for attachments
found to be malicious is also shown here.
. *URLs*: This tab lists URLs found in the email with other details
about the URLs. The number of URLs is limited to 10 right now, but these
10 are prioritized to show _malicious URLs first_. Prioritization saves
you time and guess-work. The URLs that were found to be malicious and
detonated will also be shown here.
. *Similar emails*: This tab lists all emails similar to the _network
message id + recipient_ combination specific to this email. Similarity
is based on the _body of the message_, only. The determinations made on
mails to categorize them as `similar' don’t include a consideration of
_attachments_.

=== Available on the email entity page

Here are some helpful specifics to get started.

==== Email preview and download for Cloud mailboxes

Admins can preview and download emails in Cloud mailboxes, *_if_* the
mails are still accessible to Microsoft in an Exchange Online mailbox.
In case of a soft delete (by an admin, or user), or ZAP (to quarantine),
the emails are no longer present in the Exchange Online mailbox. In that
case, admins won’t be able to preview or download those specific emails.
Emails that were dropped, or where delivery failed, never made it into
the mailbox and as a result, admins won’t be able to preview or download
those emails either.

____
[!WARNING] Previewing and downloading emails requires a special role
called *Preview*. You can add this role in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal as described in
link:++mdo-portal-permissions.md#email--collaboration-roles-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal++[Email
& collaboration roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal]. You might
need to create a new *Email & collaboration* role group there and add
the *Preview* role to that new role group or add the *Preview* role to a
role group that allows admins in your organization to work in
*Explorer*.
____

==== Detonation details

These details are specific to email attachments and URLs. Users can see
these details by going to Explorer and applying the _detection
technology_ filter set to file detonation or URL detonation. Emails
filtered for file detonation will contain a malicious file with
detonation details, and those filtered for URLs contain a malicious URL
and its detonation details.

Users will see enriched detonation details for known malicious
attachments or URLs found in their emails, which got detonated for their
specific tenant. It will include the Detonation chain, Detonation
summary, Screenshot, and Observed behavior details to help customers
understand why the attachment or URL was deemed malicious and detonated.

[arabic]
. _Detonation chain_. A single file or URL detonation can trigger
multiple detonations. The Detonation chain tracks the path of
detonations, including the original malicious file or URL that caused
the verdict, and all other files or URLs affected by the detonation.
These URLs or attached files may not be directly present in the email,
but including that analysis is important to determining why the file or
URL was found to be malicious.
+
____
[!NOTE] This may show just the top level item if none of the entities
linked to it were found to be problematic, or were detonated.
____
. _Detonation Summary_ gives a basic summary for detonation such as
_analysis time_, the time when detonation occurred, OS and application,
the operating system and application in which the detonation occurred,
file size, and verdict reason.
. _Screenshots_ show the screenshots captured during detonation. There
can be multiple screenshots during detonation. No screenshots are
captured for
* Container type files like .zip or .rar.
* If a URL opens into a link that directly downloads a file. However,
you’ll see the downloaded file in the detonation chain.
. _Behavior Details_ are an export that shows behavior details like
exact events that took place during detonation, and observables that
contain URLs, IPs, domains, and files that were found during detonation
(and can either be problematic or benign). Be aware, there may be no
behavior details for:
* Container files like .zip or .rar that are holding other files.

==== Other features that make the Email entity page helpful

_Tags_: These are tags applied to users. If the user is a recipient,
admins will see a _recipient_ tag. Likewise, if the user is a sender, a
_sender_ tag. This will appear in the left side of the email entities
page (in the part that’s described as _sticky_ and, thus, anchored to
the page).

_Latest delivery location_: The latest delivery location is the location
where an email landed after system actions like ZAP, or admin actions
like Move to Deleted Items, finish. Latest delivery location isn’t
intended to inform admins of the message’s _current_ location. For
example, if a user deletes a message, or moves it to archive, the
delivery location won’t be updated. However, if a system action has
taken place and updated the location (like a ZAP resulting in an email
moving to quarantine) this would update the Latest delivery location to
quarantine.

_Email details_: Details required for a deeper understanding of email
available in the _Analysis_ tab.

* _Exchange transport rules (also known as mail flow rules or ETRs)_:
These rules are applied to a message at the transport layer and take
precedence over phish and spam verdicts. Mail flow rules are created and
modified in the Exchange admin center at
https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/transportrules, but if any mail
flow rule applies to a message, the rule name and GUID will be shown
here. Valuable information for tracking purposes.
* _Primary Override: Source_: Primary override and source refer to the
tenant or user setting which impacted the delivery of the email,
overriding the delivery location given by the system (as per the threat
and detection technology). As an example, this could be an email blocked
due to a tenant configured transport rule or an email allowed due to an
end-user setting for Safe Senders.
* _All Overrides_: All Overrides refer to the list of overrides (tenant
or user settings) that was applied on the email, which may or may not
have impacted the delivery of an email. As an example, if a tenant
configured transport rule, as well as a tenant configured policy setting
(for example, from the Tenant Allow Block lists), is applied to an
email, then both will be listed in this field. You can check the primary
override field to determine the setting that impacted the delivery of
the email.
* _Bulk Complaint Level (BCL)_: The bulk complaint level (BCL) of the
message. A higher BCL indicates a bulk mail message is more likely to
generate complaints (the natural result if the email is likely to be
spam).
* _Spam Confidence Level (SCL)_: The spam confidence level (SCL) of the
message. A higher value indicates the message is more likely to be spam.
* _Client type_: Indicates the Client type from which the email was sent
like REST.
* _Forwarding_: For scenarios with autoforwarding, it indicates the
forwarding user as well as the forwarding type like ETR or SMTP
forwarding.
* _Distribution list_: Shows the distribution list, if the recipient
received the email as a member of the list. It shows the top level
distribution list if there are nested distribution lists involved.
* _To, Cc_: Indicates the addresses that are listed in To, Cc fields of
an email. The information in these fields is restricted to 5000
characters.
* _Domain Name_: Is the sender domain name.
* _Domain Owner_: Specifies the owner of the sending domain.
* _Domain Location_: Specifies the location of the sending domain.
* _Domain Created Date_: Specifies the date of creation of the sending
domain. A newly created domain is something you could be cautious of if
other signals indicate some suspicious behavior.

_Email Authentication_: Email authentication methods used by Microsoft
365 include SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

* Sender Policy Framework (*SPF*): Describes results for SPF check for
the message. Possible values can be:
** Pass (IP address): The SPF check for the message passed and includes
the sender’s IP address. The client is authorized to send or relay email
on behalf of the sender’s domain.
** Fail (IP address): The SPF check for the message failed, and includes
the sender’s IP address. This is sometimes called hard fail.
** Softfail (reason): The SPF record designated the host as not being
allowed to send but is in transition.
** Neutral: The SPF record explicitly states that it does not assert
whether the IP address is authorized to send.
** None: The domain doesn’t have an SPF record, or the SPF record
doesn’t evaluate to a result.
** Temperror: A temporary error has occurred. For example, a DNS error.
The same check later might succeed.
** Permerror: A permanent error has occurred. For example, the domain
has a badly formatted SPF record.
* DomainKeys Identified Mail (*DKIM*):
** Pass: Indicates the DKIM check for the message passed.
** Fail (reason): Indicates the DKIM check for the message failed and
why. For example, if the message was not signed or the signature was not
verified.
** None: Indicates that the message wasn’t signed. This may or may not
indicate that the domain has a DKIM record or the DKIM record doesn’t
evaluate to a result, only that this message was not signed.
* Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(*DMARC*):
** Pass: Indicates the DMARC check for the message passed.
** Fail: Indicates the DMARC check for the message failed.
** Bestguesspass: Indicates that no DMARC TXT record for the domain
exists, but if one had existed, the DMARC check for the message would
have passed.
** None: Indicates that no DMARC TXT record exists for the sending
domain in DNS.

_Composite Authentication_: This is a value used by Microsoft 365 to
combine email authentication like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, to determine if
the message is authentic. It uses the _From:_ domain of the mail as the
basis of evaluation.

=== Actions you can take on the Email entity Page

Security teams can now take email actions like soft delete and hard
delete, move to junk, move to inbox, trigger an investigation, submit to
Microsoft for review in line, and et cetera. *Tenant level block*
actions like file and URL or sender can also be triggered from the Email
entity page.

You will be able to select *Take actions* from the top right corner of
the entity page and this will open the Action wizard for you to select
the specific action you need.
image:../../media/Take-ActionWizard-Email-entity.png[Take action from
entity page.]

In the Action wizard you can take email actions, email submissions,
block sender and sender domain, investigative actions and two step
approval (add to remediation) in the same side pane. This follows a
consistent flow for ease of use. The Action wizard uses the same system
as is used by Explorer actions (for Delete, Submissions, and
Investigation actions), for example. You will be able to see and track
these actions in the
https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history[Unified action
center] (for deleted emails), in the
https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission[Submission portal] (for
submissions), and in
https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList[Tenant Allow/Block
Lists] page for (TABL blocks).

We are also bringing Tenant level block URL and attachment to the
respective Email entity URL and Attachments tabs. Upon approval, all the
Tenant Allow and Block Lists (or TABL) block URL and block attachments
can be tracked under TABL/URL and TABL/file pages.
image:../../media/Block-URL-Email-entity.png[Take block URL action from
entity page.]

See link:mdo-portal-permissions.md[permissions] required to take these
actions.

==== The Email summary panel

The email summary panel is a summarized view of the full email entity
page. It contains standardized details about the email (for example,
detections), as well as context-specific information (for example, for
Quarantine or Submissions metadata). The email summary panel replaces
the traditional email flyouts throughout Microsoft Defender for Office
365.
