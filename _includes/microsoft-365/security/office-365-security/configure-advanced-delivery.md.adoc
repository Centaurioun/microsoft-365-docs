== Configure the delivery of third-party phishing simulations to users and unfiltered messages to SecOps mailboxes

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.adoc[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to*

* xref:exchange-online-protection-overview.adoc[Exchange Online Protection]
* xref:defender-for-office-365.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2]
* xref:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender]

To keep your organization xref:secure-by-default.adoc[secure by default], Exchange Online Protection (EOP) does not allow safe lists or filtering bypass for messages that are identified as malware or high confidence phishing.
But, there are specific scenarios that require the delivery of unfiltered messages.
For example:

* *Third-party phishing simulations*: Simulated attacks can help you identify vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your organization.
* *Security operations (SecOps) mailboxes*: Dedicated mailboxes that are used by security teams to collect and analyze unfiltered messages (both good and bad).

You use the _advanced delivery policy_ in Microsoft 365 to prevent inbound messages _in these specific scenarios_ from being filtered^*^.
The advanced delivery policy ensures that messages in these scenarios achieve the following results:

* Filters in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 take no action on these messages.^*^
* xref:zero-hour-auto-purge.adoc[Zero-hour Purge (ZAP)] for spam and phishing take no action on these messages^**^.
* link:/microsoft-365/compliance/alert-policies#default-alert-policies[Default system alerts] aren't triggered for these scenarios.
* xref:office-365-air.adoc[AIR and clustering in Defender for Office 365] ignores these messages.
* Specifically for third-party phishing simulations:
 ** xref:admin-submission.adoc[Admin submissions] generates an automatic response saying that the message is part of a phishing simulation campaign and isn't a real threat.
Alerts and AIR will not be triggered.
The admin submissions experience will show these messages as a simulated threat.
 ** When a user reports a phishing simulation message using the xref:enable-the-report-message-add-in.adoc[Report Message or the Report Phishing add-ins], the system will not generate an alert, investigation, or incident.
The links or files will not be detonated, but the message will appear on the *User reported messages* tab of the *Submissions* page.
 ** xref:safe-links.adoc[Safe Links in Defender for Office 365] doesn't block or detonate the specifically identified URLs in these messages at time of click.
URLs are still wrapped, but they aren't blocked.
 ** xref:safe-attachments.adoc[Safe Attachments in Defender for Office 365] doesn't detonate attachments in these messages.

^*^ You can't bypass malware filtering.

^**^ You can bypass ZAP for malware by creating an anti-malware policy for the SecOps mailbox where ZAP for malware is turned off.
For instructions, see xref:configure-anti-malware-policies.adoc[Configure anti-malware policies in EOP].

Messages that are identified by the advanced delivery policy aren't security threats, so the messages are marked with system overrides.
Admin experiences will show these messages as due to either a *Phishing simulation* system override or a *SecOps mailbox* system override.
Admins can filter and analyze on these system overrides in the following experiences:

* xref:threat-explorer.adoc[Threat Explorer/Real-time detections in Defender for Office 365 plan 2]: Admin can filter on *System override source* and select either *Phishing simulation* or *SecOps Mailbox*.
* The xref:mdo-email-entity-page.adoc[Email entity Page in Threat Explorer/Real-time detections]: Admin can view a message that was allowed by organization policy by either *SecOps mailbox* or *Phishing simulation* under *Tenant override* in the *Override(s)* section.
* The link:view-email-security-reports.md#threat-protection-status-report[Threat protection status report]: Admin can filter by *view data by System override* in the drop down menu and select to see messages allowed due to a phishing simulation system override.
To see messages allowed by the SecOps mailbox override, you can select *chart breakdown by delivery location* in the *chart breakdown by reason* drop down menu.
* xref:../defender-endpoint/advanced-hunting-overview.adoc[Advanced hunting in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint]: Phishing simulation and SecOps mailbox system overrides will show as options within OrgLevelPolicy in EmailEvents.
* xref:campaigns.adoc[Campaign Views]: Admin can filter on *System override source* and select either *Phishing simulation* or *SecOps Mailbox*.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

  *** CIDR IP: For example, 192.168.0.1/25.
 ** *Simulation URLs to allow*: Expand this setting and optionally enter specific URLs that are part of your phishing simulation campaign that should not be blocked or detonated by clicking in the box, entering a value, and then pressing Enter or selecting the value that's displayed below the box.
You can add up to 10 entries.
For the URL syntax format, see link:allow-block-urls.md#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list[URL syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List].
These URLs are wrapped at the time of click, but they aren't blocked.

+
To remove an existing value, click remove image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png[Remove icon.] next to the value.
+
____
[!NOTE] To configure a third-party phishing simulation in Advanced Delivery, you need to provide the following information:

* At least one *Domain* from either of the following sources:
 ** The `5321.MailFrom` address (also known as the MAIL FROM address, P1 sender, or envelope sender).
 ** The DKIM domain.
* At least one *Sending IP*.

You can optionally include *Simulation URLs to allow* to ensure that URLs in simulation messages are not blocked.

You can specify up to 10 entries for each field.

There must be a match on at least one *Domain* and one *Sending IP*, but no association between values is maintained.
____
. When you're finished, click *Add*, and then click *Close*.

The third-party phishing simulation entries that you configured are displayed on the *Phishing simulation* tab.

=== Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify or remove third-party phishing simulations in the advanced delivery policy

. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Email & Collaboration* > *Policies & Rules* > *Threat policies* > *Advanced delivery* in the *Rules* section.
To go directly to the *Advanced delivery* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/advanceddelivery.
. On the *Advanced delivery* page, select the *Phishing simulation* tab, and then click image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png[Edit icon.] *Edit*.
. In the *Edit third-party phishing simulation* flyout that opens, you add or remove entries for *Domain*, *Sending IP*, and *Simulation URLs* as described in the previous section.
+
To remove all entries, click remove image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png[Remove icon.] next to each value until there are no more domains, IPs, or URLs selected.

. When you're finished, click *Save* and then click *Close*.

=== Additional scenarios that require filtering bypass

In addition to the two scenarios that the advanced delivery policy can help you with, there are other scenarios where you might need to bypass filtering:

* *Third-party filters*: If your domain's MX record _doesn't_ point to Office 365 (messages are routed somewhere else first), xref:secure-by-default.adoc[secure by default] _is not available_.
If you'd like to add protection, you'll need to enable Enhanced Filtering for Connectors (also known as _skip listing_).
For more information, see link:/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud[Manage mail flow using a third-party cloud service with Exchange Online].
If you don't want Enhanced Filtering for Connectors, use mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) to bypass Microsoft filtering for messages that have already been evaluated by third-party filtering.
For more information, see link:/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/use-rules-to-set-scl[Use mail flow rules to set the SCL in messages].
* *False positives under review*: You might want to temporarily allow certain messages that are still being analyzed by Microsoft via xref:admin-submission.adoc[admin submissions] to report known good messages that are incorrectly being marked as bad to Microsoft (false positives).
As with all overrides, we _*highly recommended*_ that these allowances are temporary.

=== PowerShell procedures for SecOps mailboxes in the advanced delivery policy

In PowerShell, the basic elements of SecOps mailboxes in the advanced delivery policy are:

* *The SecOps override policy*: Controlled by the **-SecOpsOverridePolicy* cmdlets.
* *The SecOps override rule*: Controlled by the **-SecOpsOverrideRule* cmdlets.

This behavior has the following results:

* You create the policy first, then you create the rule that identifies the policy that the rule applies to.
* When you remove a policy from PowerShell, the corresponding rule is also removed.
* When you remove a rule from PowerShell, the corresponding policy is not removed.
You need to remove the corresponding policy manually.

==== Use PowerShell to configure SecOps mailboxes

Configuring a SecOps mailbox in the advanced delivery policy in PowerShell is a two-step process:

. Create the SecOps override policy.
. Create the SecOps override rule that specifies the policy that the rule applies to.

===== Step 1: Use PowerShell to create the SecOps override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Name SecOpsOverridePolicy -SentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>
----

____
[!NOTE] Regardless of the Name value you specify, the policy name will be _SecOpsOverridePolicy_, so you might as well use that value.
____

This example creates the SecOps mailbox policy.

[,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Name SecOpsOverridePolicy -SentTo secops@contoso.com
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-secopsoverridepolicy[New-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

===== Step 2: Use PowerShell to create the SecOps override rule

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], run the following command:

[,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverrideRule -Name SecOpsOverrideRule -Policy SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

____
[!NOTE] Regardless of the Name value you specify, the rule name will be _SecOpsOverrideRule_<GUID> where <GUID> is a unique GUID value (for example, 6fed4b63-3563-495d-a481-b24a311f8329).
____

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-secopsoverriderule[New-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to view the SecOps override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about the one and only SecOps mailbox policy.

[,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-secopsoverridepolicy[Get-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to view SecOps override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about SecOps override rules.

[,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverrideRule
----

Although the previous command should return only one rule, any rules that are pending deletion might also be included in the results.

This example identifies the valid rule (one) and any invalid rules.

[,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverrideRule | Format-Table Name,Mode
----

After you identify the invalid rules, you can remove them by using the *Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule* cmdlet as described <<use-powershell-to-remove-secops-override-rules,later in this article>>.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-secopsoverriderule[Get-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the SecOps override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy [-AddSentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>] [-RemoveSentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>]
----

This example adds `secops2@contoso.com` to the SecOps override policy.

[,powershell]
----
Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy -AddSentTo secops2@contoso.com
----

____
[!NOTE] If an associated, valid SecOps override rule exists, the email addresses in the rule will also be updated.
____

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-secopsoverridepolicy[Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to modify a SecOps override rule

The *Set-SecOpsOverrideRule* cmdlet does not modify the email addresses in the SecOps override rule.
To modify the email addresses in the SecOps override rule, use the *Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy* cmdlet.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-secopsoverriderule[Set-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to remove the SecOps override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], this example removes the SecOps Mailbox policy and the corresponding rule.

[,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/remove-secopsoverridepolicy[Remove-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to remove SecOps override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule -Identity <RuleIdentity>
----

This example removes the specified SecOps override rule.

[,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule -Identity SecOpsOverrideRule6fed4b63-3563-495d-a481-b24a311f8329
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/remove-secopsoverriderule[Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule].

=== PowerShell procedures for third-party phishing simulations in the advanced delivery policy

In PowerShell, the basic elements of third-party phishing simulations in the advanced delivery policy are:

* *The phishing simulation override policy*: Controlled by the **-PhishSimOverridePolicy* cmdlets.
* *The phishing simulation override rule*: Controlled by the **-PhishSimOverrideRule* cmdlets.
* *The allowed (unblocked) phishing simulation URLs*: Controlled by the **-TenantAllowBlockListItems* cmdlets.

This behavior has the following results:

* You create the policy first, then you create the rule that identifies the policy that the rule applies to.
* You modify the settings in the policy and the rule separately.
* When you remove a policy from PowerShell, the corresponding rule is also removed.
* When you remove a rule from PowerShell, the corresponding policy is not removed.
You need to remove the corresponding policy manually.

==== Use PowerShell to configure third-party phishing simulations

Configuring a third-party phishing simulation in PowerShell is a multi-step process:

. Create the phishing simulation override policy.
. Create the phishing simulation override rule that specifies:
 ** The policy that the rule applies to.
 ** The source IP address of the phishing simulation messages.
. Optionally, identity the phishing simulation URLs that should be allowed (that is, not blocked or scanned).

===== Step 1: Use PowerShell to create the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], this example creates the phishing simulation override policy.

[,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Name PhishSimOverridePolicy
----

NOTE: Regardless of the Name value you specify, the policy name will be _PhishSimOverridePolicy_, so you might as well use that value.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-phishsimoverridepolicy[New-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

===== Step 2: Use PowerShell to create the phishing simulation override rule

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverrideRule -Name PhishSimOverrideRule -Policy PhishSimOverridePolicy -Domains <Domain1>,<Domain2>,...<Domain10> -SenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntry10>
----

Regardless of the Name value you specify, the rule name will be _PhishSimOverrideRule_<GUID> where <GUID> is a unique GUID value (for example, a0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011).

A valid IP address entry is one of the following values:

* Single IP: For example, 192.168.1.1.
* IP range: For example, 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.254.
* CIDR IP: For example, 192.168.0.1/25.

This example creates the phishing simulation override rule with the specified settings.

[,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverrideRule -Name PhishSimOverrideRule -Policy PhishSimOverridePolicy -Domains fabrikam.com,wingtiptoys.com -SenderIpRanges 192.168.1.55
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-phishsimoverriderule[New-PhishSimOverrideRule].

===== Step 3: (Optional) Use PowerShell to identify the phishing simulation URLs to allow

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -Allow -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery -Entries "<URL1>","<URL2>",..."<URL10>" <[-NoExpiration] | [-ExpirationDate <DateTime>]>
----

For details about the URL syntax, see link:allow-block-urls.md#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list[URL syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List]

This example adds a URL allow entry for the specified third-party phishing simulation URL with no expiration.

[,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -Allow -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery -Entries *.fabrikam.com -NoExpiration
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistitems[New-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

==== Use PowerShell to view the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about the one and only phishing simulation override policy.

[,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-phishsimoverridepolicy[Get-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to view phishing simulation override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about phishing simulation override rules.

[,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverrideRule
----

Although the previous command should return only one rule, any rules that are pending deletion might also be included in the results.

This example identifies the valid rule (one) and any invalid rules.

[,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverrideRule | Format-Table Name,Mode
----

After you identify the invalid rules, you can remove them by using the *Remove-PhishSimOverrideRule* cmdlet as described <<use-powershell-to-remove-phishing-simulation-override-rules,later in this article>>.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-phishsimoverriderule[Get-PhishSimOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to view the allowed phishing simulation URL entries

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], run the following command:

[,powershell]
----
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-tenantallowblocklistitems[Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Identity PhishSimOverridePolicy [-Comment "<DescriptiveText>"] [-Enabled <$true | $false>]
----

This example disables the phishing simulation override policy.

[,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Identity PhishSimOverridePolicy -Enabled $false
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-phishsimoverridepolicy[Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to modify phishing simulation override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverrideRule -Identity PhishSimOverrideRulea0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011 [-Comment "<DescriptiveText>"] [-AddSenderDomainIs <DomainEntry1>,<DomainEntry2>,...<DomainEntryN>] [-RemoveSenderDomainIs <DomainEntry1>,<DomainEntry2>,...<DomainEntryN>] [-AddSenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntryN>] [-RemoveSenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntryN>]
----

This example modifies the specified phishing simulation override rule with the following settings:

* Add the domain entry blueyonderairlines.com.
* Remove the IP address entry 192.168.1.55.

Note that these changes don't affect existing entries.

[,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverrideRule -Identity PhishSimOverrideRulea0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011 -AddSenderDomainIs blueyonderairlines.com -RemoveSenderIpRanges 192.168.1.55
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-phishsimoverriderule[Set-PhishSimOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the allowed phishing simulation URL entries

You can't modify the URL values directly.
You can <<use-powershell-to-remove-the-allowed-phishing-simulation-url-entries,remove existing URL entries>> and <<step-3-optional-use-powershell-to-identify-the-phishing-simulation-urls-to-allow,add new URL entries>> as described in this article.

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange Online PowerShell], to modify other properties of an allowed phishing simulation URL entry (for example, the expiration date or comments), use the following syntax:

[,powershell]
----
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems <-Entries "<URL1>","<URL2>",..."<URLN>" | -Ids <Identity>> -ListType URL -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery <[-NoExpiration] | [-ExpirationDate <DateTime>]> [-Notes <String>]
----

You identify the entry to modify by its URL values (the _Entries_ parameter) or the Identity value from the output of the *Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems* cmdlet (the _Ids_ parameter).

This example modified the expiration date of the specified entry.

[,powershell]
----
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery -Entries "*.fabrikam.com" -ExpirationDate 9/11/2021
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-tenantallowblocklistitems[Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

==== Use PowerShell to remove a phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security & Compliance PowerShell], this example removes the phishing simulation override policy and the corresponding rule.

[,powershell]
----
