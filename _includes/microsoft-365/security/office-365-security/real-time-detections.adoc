This article explains the difference between Explorer and real-time
detections reporting, updated experience with Explorer and real-time
detections where you can toggle between old and new experiences, and the
licenses and permissions that are required.

If your organization has link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft
Defender for Office 365], and you have the
link:#required-licenses-and-permissions[permissions], you can use
*Explorer* (also known as *Threat Explorer*) or *Real-time detections*
to detect and remediate threats.

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com,
go to *Email & collaboration*, and then choose *Explorer* _or_
*Real-time detections*. To go directly to the page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorer or
https://security.microsoft.com/realtimereports.

With these tools, you can:

* See malware detected by Microsoft 365 security features.
* View phishing URL and click verdict data.
* Start an automated investigation and response process from a view in
Explorer.
* Investigate malicious email, and more.

For more information, see
link:email-security-in-microsoft-defender.md[Email security with
Explorer].

=== Differences between Explorer and Real-time detections

* _Real-time detections_ is a reporting tool available in Defender for
Office 365 Plan 1. _Threat Explorer_ is a threat hunting and remediation
tool available in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.
* The Real-time detections report allows you to view detections in real
time. Threat Explorer does this as well, but it provides additional
details for a given attack, such as highlighting attack campaigns, and
gives security operations teams the ability to remediate threats
(including triggering an link:air-about-office.md[Automated
Investigation and Response investigation].
* An _All email_ view is available in Threat Explorer, but not included
in the Real-time detections report.
* Rich filtering capabilities and remediation actions are included in
Threat Explorer. For more information, see
link:/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-advanced-threat-protection-service-description#feature-availability-across-advanced-threat-protection-atp-plans[Microsoft
Defender for Office 365 Service Description: Feature availability across
Defender for Office 365 plans].

=== Updated experience for Explorer and Real-time detections

The experience for Threat Explorer and Real-time detections is updated
to align with modern accessibility standards, and to optimize the
workflow. For a short while, you will be able to toggle between the old
experience and the new one.

else within your tenant.

Threat Explorer and Real-time detections is divided into the following
views:

* _All email_: Shows all email analyzed by Defender for office 365 and
contains both good and malicious emails. This feature is only present in
Threat Explorer and is not available for Real-time detections. By
default, it is set to show data for two days, which can be expanded up
to 30 days. This is also the default view for Threat Explorer.
* _Malware view_: Shows emails on which a malware threat was identified.
This is the default view for Real-time detections, and shows data for
two days (can be expanded to 30 days).
* _Phish view_: Shows emails on which a phish threat was identified.
* _Content malware view_: Shows malicious detections identified in files
shared through OneDrive, SharePoint, or Teams.

Here are the common components within these experiences:

* Filters
** You can use the various filters to view the data based on email or
file attributes.
** By default, the time filter is applied to the records, and is applied
for two days.
** If you are applying multiple filters, they are applied in `AND' mode
and you can use the advanced filter to change it to `OR' mode.
** You can use commas to add multiple values for the same filter.

* Charts
** Charts provide a visual, aggregate view of data based on filters. You
can use different filters to view the data by different dimensions.
+
____
[!NOTE] You may see no results in chart view even if you are seeing an
entry in the list view. This happens if the filter does not produce any
data. For example, if you have applied the filter malware family, but
the underlying data does not have any malicious emails, then you may see
the message no data available for this scenario.

* Detailed flyout
** You can click on hyperlinks to get to the email summary panel
(entries in Subject column), recipient, or IP flyout.
** The email summary panel replaces the legacy email flyout, and also
provides a path to access the email entity panel.
** The individual entity flyouts like IP, recipient, and URL would
reflect the same information, but presented in a single tab-based view,
with the ability to expand and collapse the different sections based on
requirement.
** For flyouts like URLs, you can click *View all Email* or *View all
Clicks* to view the full set of emails/clicks containing that URL, as
well as export the result set.
* Actions
** From Threat Explorer, you can trigger remediation actions like
_Delete an email_. For more information on remediation, remediation
limits, and tracking remediation see
link:remediate-malicious-email-delivered-office-365.md[Remediate
malicious email].
* Export
** You can click *Export chart data* to export the chart details.
Similarly, click *Export email list* to export email details.
** You can export up to 200K records for email list. However, for better
system performance and reduced download time, you should use various
email filters.
