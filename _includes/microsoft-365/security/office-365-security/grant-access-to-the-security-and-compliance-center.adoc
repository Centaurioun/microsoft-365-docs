Users need to be assigned permissions in the Security & Compliance
Center before they can manage any of its security or compliance
features. As a global admin or member of the OrganizationManagement role
group in the Security & Compliance Center, you can give these
permissions to users. Users will only be able to manage the security or
compliance features that you give them access to.

For more information about the different permissions you can give to
users in the Security & Compliance Center, check out
link:permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md[Permissions in
the Security & Compliance Center].

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* You need to be a global admin, or a member of the
OrganizationManagement role group in the Security & Compliance Center,
to complete the steps in this article.
* Role groups for the Security & Compliance Center might have similar
names to the role groups in Exchange Online, but they’re not the same.
* Role group memberships aren’t shared between Exchange Online and the
Security & Compliance Center.
* Delegated Access Permission (DAP) partners with Administer On Behalf
Of (AOBO) permissions can’t access the Security & Compliance Center.

=== Use the Security & Compliance Center to give another user access to the Security & Compliance Center

[arabic]
. Open the Security & Compliance Center at https://protection.office.com
and then go to *Permissions*. To go directly to the *Permissions* tab,
open https://protection.office.com/permissions.
. From the list of role groups, choose the role group, and then click
*Edit* image:../../media/O365-MDM-CreatePolicy-EditIcon.gif[Edit icon.].
. In the role group’s properties page under *Members*, click
*Add*image:../../media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif[Add Icon.] and select the
name of the user (or users) you want to add.
. When you’ve selected all of the users you want to add to the role
group, click *add->* and then *OK*.
. When you’re finished, click *Save*.

=== Use Security & Compliance PowerShell to give another user access to the Security & Compliance Center

[arabic]
. link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Connect to
Security & Compliance PowerShell].
. Use the following syntax:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity <RoleGroup> -Member <UserIdentity>

- _Identity_ is the role group.
- _Member_ is the user or universal security group (USG). You can specify only one member at a time.

This example adds MatildaS to the Organization Management role group.

```PowerShell
Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity "Organization Management" -Member MatildaS
----
