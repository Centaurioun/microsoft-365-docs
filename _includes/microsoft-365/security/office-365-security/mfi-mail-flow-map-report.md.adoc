By default, the widget shows the mail flow pattern from the previous day in a chart known as a _Sankey_ diagram.
You can use the left arrow image:../../media/scc-left-arrow.png[Left arrow.] and right arrow image:../../media/scc-right-arrow.png[Right arrow] to show information from different days.
Each different color represents mail flow over a different inbound or outbound connector (or without using connectors).
If you hover over a specific color, the number of messages is displayed for that type of connector.
