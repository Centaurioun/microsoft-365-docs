link:defender-for-office-365.md#whats-the-difference-between-microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-and-plan-2[Microsoft
Defender for Office 365 Plan 2] includes powerful
link:air-about.md[automated investigation and response] (AIR)
capabilities. Such capabilities can save your security operations team a
lot of time and effort dealing with threats. This article describes one
of the facets of the AIR capabilities, the compromised user security
playbook.

The compromised user security playbook enables your organization’s
security team to:

* Speed up detection of compromised user accounts;
* Limit the scope of a breach when an account is compromised; and
* Respond to compromised users more effectively and efficiently.

=== Compromised user alerts

When a user account is compromised, atypical or anomalous behaviors
occur. For example, phishing and spam messages might be sent internally
from a trusted user account. Defender for Office 365 can detect such
anomalies in email patterns and collaboration activity within Office
365. When this happens, alerts are triggered, and the threat mitigation
process begins.

=== Investigate and respond to a compromised user

When a user account is compromised, alerts are triggered. And in some
cases, that user account is blocked and prevented from sending any
further email messages until the issue is resolved by your
organization’s security operations team. In other cases, an automated
investigation begins which can result in recommended actions that your
security team should take.

==== View and investigate restricted users

You have a few options for navigating to a list of restricted users. For
example, in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you can go to *Email &
collaboration* > *Review* > *Restricted Users*. The following procedure
describes navigation using the *Alerts* dashboard, which is a good way
to see various kinds of alerts that might have been triggered.

[arabic]
. Open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com and go to *Incidents & alerts* >
*Alerts*. Or, to go directly to the *Alerts* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/alerts.
. On the *Alerts* page, filter the results by time period and the policy
named *User restricted from sending email*.

. If you select the entry by clicking on the name, a *User restricted
from sending email* page opens with additional details for you to
review. Next to the *Manage alert* button, you can click

*More options* and then select *View restricted user details* to go to
the *Restricted users* page, where you can

==== View details about automated investigations

When an automated investigation has begun, you can see its details and
results in the *Action center* in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

To learn more, see link:air-view-investigation-results.md[View details
of an investigation].

=== Keep the following points in mind

* *Stay on top of your alerts*. As you know, the longer a compromise
goes undetected, the larger the potential for widespread impact and cost
to your organization, customers, and partners. Early detection and
timely response are critical to mitigate threats, and especially when a
user’s account is compromised.
* *Automation assists your security operations team*. Automated
investigation and response capabilities can detect a compromised user
early on and enable your security operations team to take action to
remediate the threat. Need some help with this? See
