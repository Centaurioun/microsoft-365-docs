link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for Office 365]
includes powerful automated investigation and response (AIR)
capabilities that can save your security operations team time and
effort. As alerts are triggered, it’s up to your security operations
team to review, prioritize, and respond to those alerts. Keeping up with
the volume of incoming alerts can be overwhelming. Automating some of
those tasks can help.

AIR enables your security operations team to operate more efficiently
and effectively. AIR capabilities include automated investigation
processes in response to well-known threats that exist today.
Appropriate remediation actions await approval, enabling your security
operations team to respond effectively to detected threats. With AIR,
your security operations team can focus on higher-priority tasks without
losing sight of important alerts that are triggered.

=== The overall flow of AIR

An alert is triggered, and a security playbook starts an automated
investigation, which results in findings and recommended actions. Here’s
the overall flow of AIR, step by step:

[arabic]
. An automated investigation is initiated in one of the following ways:
* Either link:#which-alert-policies-trigger-automated-investigations[an
alert is triggered] by something suspicious in email (such as a message,
attachment, URL, or compromised user account). An incident is created,
and an automated investigation begins; or
* A security analyst
link:automated-investigation-response-office.md#example-a-security-administrator-triggers-an-investigation-from-threat-explorer[starts
an automated investigation] while using
link:threat-explorer.md[Explorer].
. While an automated investigation runs, it gathers data about the email
in question and entities related to that email. Such entities can
include files, URLs, and recipients. The investigation’s scope can
increase as new and related alerts are triggered.
. During and after an automated investigation,
link:air-view-investigation-results.md[details and results] are
available to view. Results include
link:air-remediation-actions.md[recommended actions] that can be taken
to respond to and remediate any threats that were found.
. Your security operations team reviews the
link:air-view-investigation-results.md[investigation results and
recommendations], and
link:air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md[approves or rejects
remediation actions].
. As pending remediation actions are approved (or rejected), the
automated investigation completes.

In Microsoft Defender for Office 365, no remediation actions are taken
automatically. Remediation actions are taken only upon approval by your
organization’s security team. AIR capabilities save your security
operations team time by identifying remediation actions and providing
the details needed to make an informed decision.

During and after each automated investigation, your security operations
team can:

* link:air-view-investigation-results.md#view-details-about-an-alert-related-to-an-investigation[View
details about an alert related to an investigation]
* link:air-view-investigation-results.md#view-details-of-an-investigation[View
the results details of an investigation]
* link:air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md[Review and
approve actions as a result of an investigation]

=== How to get AIR

AIR capabilities are included in
link:defender-for-office-365.md#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-and-plan-2[Microsoft
Defender for Office 365], provided your policies and alerts are
configured. Need some help? Follow the guidance in
link:protect-against-threats.md[Protect against threats] to set up or
configure the following protection settings:

* link:../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md[Audit
logging] (should be turned on)
* link:++protect-against-threats.md#part-1---anti-malware-protection-in-eop++[Anti-malware
protection]
* link:++../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md#part-2---anti-phishing-protection-in-eop-and-defender-for-office-365++[Anti-phishing
protection]
* link:++protect-against-threats.md#part-3---anti-spam-protection-in-eop++[Anti-spam
protection]
* link:++protect-against-threats.md#part-4---protection-from-malicious-urls-and-files-safe-links-and-safe-attachments-in-defender-for-office-365++[Safe
Links and Safe Attachments]

In addition, make sure to link:../../compliance/alert-policies.md[review
your organization’s alert policies], especially the
link:../../compliance/alert-policies.md#default-alert-policies[default
policies in the Threat management category].

=== Which alert policies trigger automated investigations?

Microsoft 365 provides many built-in alert policies that help identify
Exchange admin permissions abuse, malware activity, potential external
and internal threats, and information governance risks. Several of the
link:../../compliance/alert-policies.md#default-alert-policies[default
alert policies] can trigger automated investigations. The following
table describes the alerts that trigger automated investigations, their
severity in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and how they’re
generated:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Alert |Severity |How the alert is generated
|A potentially malicious URL click was detected |*High* |This alert is
generated when any of the following occurs:

|An email message is reported by a user as malware or phish
|*Informational* |This alert is generated when users in your
organization report messages as phishing email using the
link:enable-the-report-message-add-in.md[Report Message add-in] or the
link:enable-the-report-phish-add-in.md[Report Phishing add-in].

|Email messages containing malware are removed after delivery
|*Informational* |This alert is generated when any email messages
containing malware are delivered to mailboxes in your organization. If
this event occurs, Microsoft removes the infected messages from Exchange
Online mailboxes using link:zero-hour-auto-purge.md[zero-hour auto purge
(ZAP)].

|Email messages containing phish URLs are removed after delivery
|*Informational* |This alert is generated when any messages containing
phish are delivered to mailboxes in your organization. If this event
occurs, Microsoft removes the infected messages from Exchange Online
mailboxes using link:zero-hour-auto-purge.md[ZAP].

|Suspicious email sending patterns are detected |*Medium* |This alert is
generated when someone in your organization has sent suspicious email
and is at risk of being restricted from sending email. The alert is an
early warning for behavior that might indicate that the account is
compromised, but not severe enough to restrict the user.

|A user is restricted from sending email |*High* |This alert is
generated when someone in your organization is restricted from sending
outbound mail. This alert typically results when an
link:responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.md[email account is
compromised].
