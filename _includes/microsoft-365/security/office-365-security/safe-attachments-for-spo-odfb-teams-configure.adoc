Microsoft Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and
Microsoft Teams protects your organization from inadvertently sharing
malicious files. For more information, see
link:safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md[Safe Attachments for
SharePoint&#44; OneDrive&#44; and Microsoft Teams].

This article contains the steps for enabling and configuring Safe
Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com. To go directly to the *Safe Attachments*
page, use https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2.
* To turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft
Teams, you need to be a member of the *Organization Management* or
*Security Administrator* role groups in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal. For more information, see
link:mdo-portal-permissions.md[Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal].
* To use SharePoint Online PowerShell to prevent people from downloading
malicious files, you need to be member of the
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator[Global
Administrator] or
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator[SharePoint
Administrator] roles in Azure AD.
* Verify that audit logging is enabled for your organization. For more
information, see
link:../../compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md[Turn audit log
search on or off].
* Allow up to 30 minutes for the settings to take effect.

=== Step 1: Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Policies & rules* > *Threat
policies* > *Safe Attachments* in the *Policies* section. To go directly
to the *Safe Attachments* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2.
. On the *Safe Attachments* page, click *Global settings*.
. In the *Global settings* fly out that appears, go to the *Protect
files in SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams* section.
+
Move the *Turn on Defender for Office 365 for SharePoint, OneDrive, and
Microsoft Teams* toggle to the right
image:../../media/scc-toggle-on.png[Toggle on.] to turn on Safe
Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
+
When you’re finished, click *Save*.

==== Use Exchange Online PowerShell to turn on Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams

If you’d rather use PowerShell to turn on Safe Attachments for
SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams,
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[connect
to Exchange Online PowerShell] and run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-AtpPolicyForO365 -EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB $true
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-atppolicyforo365[Set-AtpPolicyForO365].

=== Step 2: (Recommended) Use SharePoint Online PowerShell to prevent users from downloading malicious files

By default, users can’t open, move, copy, or share* malicious files that
are detected by Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft
Teams. However, they can delete and download malicious files.

* If users go to *Manage access*, the *Share* option is still available.

To prevent users from downloading malicious files,
link:/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online[connect
to SharePoint Online PowerShell] and run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-SPOTenant -DisallowInfectedFileDownload $true
----

*Notes*:

* This setting affects both users and admins.
* People can still delete malicious files.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant[Set-SPOTenant].

=== Step 3 (Recommended) Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create an alert policy for detected files

You can create an alert policy that notifies you and other admins when
Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams detects a
malicious file. To learn more about alerts, see
link:../../compliance/alert-policies.md[Alert policies].

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Policies & rules* > *Alert
policy*. To go directly to the *Alert policy* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/alertpolicies.
. On the *Alert policy* page, click *New alert policy*.
. The *New alert policy* wizard opens in a fly out. On the *Name your
alert* page, configure the following settings:
* *Name*: Type a unique and descriptive name. For example, Malicious
Files in Libraries.
* *Description*: Type an optional description. For example, Notifies
admins when malicious files are detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive,
or Microsoft Teams.
* *Severity*: Select *Low*, *Medium*, or *High* from the drop down list.
* *Category*: Select *Threat management* from the drop down list.
+
When you’re finished, click *Next*.
. On the *Create alert settings* page, configure the following settings:
* *What do you want to alert on?* section > *Activity is* > Select
*Detected malware in file* from the drop down list.
* *How do you want the alert to be triggered?* section: Leave the
default value *Every time an activity matches the rule* selected.
+
When you’re finished, click *Next*.
. On the *Set your recipients* page, configure the following settings:
* Verify *Send email notifications* is selected. In the *Email
recipients* box, select one or more global administrators, security
administrators, or security readers who should receive notification when
a malicious file is detected.
* *Daily notification limit*: Leave the default value *No limit*
selected.
+
When you’re finished, click *Next*.
. On the *Review your settings* page, review your settings. You can
select *Edit* in each section to modify the settings within the section.
Or you can click *Back* or select the specific page in the wizard.
+
In the *Do you want to turn the policy on right away?* section, leave
the default value *Yes, turn it on right away* selected.
+
When you’re finished, click *Finish*.

==== Use Security & Compliance PowerShell to create an alert policy for detected files

If you’d rather use PowerShell to create the same alert policy as
described in the previous section,
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[connect to Security
& Compliance PowerShell] and run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
New-ActivityAlert -Name "Malicious Files in Libraries" -Description "Notifies admins when malicious files are detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, or Microsoft Teams" -Category ThreatManagement -Operation FileMalwareDetected -NotifyUser "admin1@contoso.com","admin2@contoso.com"
----

*Note*: The default _Severity_ value is Low. To specify Medium or High,
include the _Severity_ parameter and value in the command.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-activityalert[New-ActivityAlert].

following command to verify the property value:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-SPOTenant | Format-List DisallowInfectedFileDownload
----
+
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Set-SPOTenant[Get-SPOTenant].
* To verify that you’ve successfully configured an alert policy for
detected files, use any of the following steps:

*Alert policy* > select the alert policy, and verify the settings.
** In Microsoft 365 Defender portal PowerShell, replace
<AlertPolicyName> with the name of the alert policy, run the following
