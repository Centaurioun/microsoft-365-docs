You need to manage security scenarios that span all the Microsoft 365 services.
And you need the flexibility to give the right admin permissions to the right people in your organization.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com supports directly managing permissions for users who perform security tasks in Microsoft 365.
By using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage permissions, you can manage permissions centrally for all tasks related to security.

To manage permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to *Permissions & roles* or https://security.microsoft.com/securitypermissions.
You need to be a *global administrator* or a member of the *Organization Management* role group in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
Specifically, the *Role Management* role allows users to view, create, and modify role groups in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and by default, that role is assigned only to the *Organization Management* role group.

=== Relationship of members, roles, and role groups

Permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) permissions model.
RBAC is the same permissions model that's used by most Microsoft 365 services, so if you're familiar with the permission structure in these services, granting permissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal will be very familiar.

A *role* grants the permissions to do a set of tasks.

A *role group* is a set of roles that lets people do their jobs in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal> includes default role groups for the most common tasks and functions that you'll need to assign.
Generally, we recommend simply adding individual users as *members* to the default role groups.

=== Roles and role groups in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The following types of roles and role groups are available in on the *Permissions & roles* page at https://security.microsoft.com/securitypermissions in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:

* *Azure AD roles*: You can view the roles and assigned users, but you can't manage them directly in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
Azure AD roles are central roles that assign permissions for *all* Microsoft 365 services.
* *Email & collaboration roles*: These are the same role groups that are available in the Security & Compliance Center, but you can manage them directly in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
The permissions that you assign here are specific to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, and the Security & Compliance Center, and don't cover all of the permissions that are needed in other Microsoft 365 workloads.

==== Azure AD roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

When you open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com and go to *Email & collaboration roles* > *Permissions & roles* > *Azure AD roles* > *Roles* (or directly to https://security.microsoft.com/aadpermissions) you'll see the Azure AD roles that are described in this section.

When you select a role, a details flyout that contains the description of the role and the user assignments appears.
But to manage those assignments, you need to click *Manage members in Azure AD* in the details flyout.
