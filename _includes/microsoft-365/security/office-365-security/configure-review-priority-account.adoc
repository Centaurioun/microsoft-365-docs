Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2] -
link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender]

In every organization, there are people that are critical, like
executives, leaders, managers, or other users who have access to
sensitive, proprietary, or high priority information. You can tag these
users within Microsoft Defender for Office 365 as priority accounts,
allowing security teams to prioritize their focus on these critical
individuals. With differentiated protection for priority accounts, users
tagged as priority accounts will receive a higher level of protection
against threats.

Priority accounts are targeted by attackers more often and are generally
attacked with more sophisticated techniques. Differentiated protection
for priority accounts focuses on this specific user set and provides
higher level of protection using enhanced machine learning models. This
differentiation in learning and message handling provides the highest
level of protection for these accounts and helps maintain a low false
positive rate, as a high rate of false positives can also have a
negative impact on these users.

=== Configure Priority account protection

Priority account protection is turned on by default for pre-identified
critical users. However, the security administrator of your organization
can also turn on priority account protection by following these steps:

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Settings* > *Email &
collaboration* > *Priority account protection*. To go directly to the
*Priority account protection* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/priorityAccountProtection.
. On the *Priority account protection* page, turn on *Priority account
protection* (:::image type=``icon''
source=``../../media/scc-toggle-on.png'' border=``false'':::).

protection.

If you want to use Exchange Online PowerShell to turn on priority
account protection, do the following steps:

[arabic]
. link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Connect
to Exchange Online PowerShell] and run the following command:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Set-EmailTenantSettings -EnablePriorityAccountProtection $true
----
. To verify that priority account protection is turned on, run the
following command to verify the EnablePriorityAccountProtection property
value:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-EmailTenantSettings | Format-List Identity,EnablePriorityAccountProtection
----
+
The value True means priority account protection is turned on. The value
False means priority account protection is turned off.

==== Assign the Priority account tag to users

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 supports priority accounts as tags
that can be used as filters in alerts, reports, incidents, and more.

For more information, see link:user-tags.md[User tags in Microsoft
Defender for Office 365].

==== Threat protection status report

The *Threat protection status* report is a single view that brings
together information about malicious content and malicious email
detected and blocked by Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

To view the report, do the following steps:

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Reports* > *Email &
collaboration* > *Email & collaboration reports* > find *Threat
protection status* and then click *View details*. To go directly to the
report, use
https://security.microsoft.com/reports/TPSAggregateReportATP.
. The default view is *View data by Overview*. Click on this value to
change the view by selecting one of the following values:
* *View data by Email > Phish*
* *View data by Email > Malware*
* *View data by Email > Spam*
. Click image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png[Filter icon.]
*Filter*.

section, select *Yes*, *No* or both values.

account protection filters in the Threat protection status report.]

==== Threat Explorer

Context filter within Threat Explorer helps search for emails where
priority account protection was involved in the detection of the
message. This allows security operations teams to be able to see the
value provided by this protection. You can still filter messages by
priority account tag to find all messages for the specific set of users.

To view the extra protection in Threat Explorer, do the following steps:

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Email & collaboration* >
*Explorer*. To go directly to the *Threat Explorer* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorer.
. Select *Context* from the dropdown, and then select the checkbox next
to *Priority account protection*.
