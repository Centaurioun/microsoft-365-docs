{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:exchange-online-protection-overview.md[Exchange
Online Protection] - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender
for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2] -
link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender]

This article describes how to manage file allow and block entries that
are available in the Tenant Allow/Block List. For more information about
the Tenant Allow/Block List, see
link:manage-tenant-allow-block-list.md[Manage your allows and blocks in
the Tenant Allow/Block List].

You manage allow and block entries for files in the Microsoft 365
Defender Portal or in Exchange Online PowerShell.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com. To go directly to the *Tenant
Allow/Block List* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList. To go directly to
the *Submissions* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission.
* To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Connect
to Exchange Online PowerShell]. To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell,
see
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell[Connect
to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell].
* You specify files by using the SHA256 hash value of the file. To find
the SHA256 hash value of a file in Windows, run the following command in
a Command Prompt:
+
[source,dos]
----
certutil.exe -hashfile "<Path>\<Filename>" SHA256
----
+
An example value is
`768a813668695ef2483b2bde7cf5d1b2db0423a0d3e63e498f3ab6f2eb13ea3a`.
Perceptual hash (pHash) values are not supported.
* For files, the maximum number of allow entries is 500, and the maximum
number of block entries is 500 (1000 file entries total).
* You can enter a maximum of 64 characters in a file entry.
* An entry should be active within 30 minutes, but it might take up to
24 hours for the entry to be active.
* You need to be assigned permissions in Exchange Online before you can
do the procedures in this article:
** To add and remove values from the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need
to be a member of one of the following role groups:
*** *Organization Management* or *Security Administrator* role group
(*Security admin role*)
*** *Security Operator* role group (*Tenant AllowBlockList Manager*).
** For read-only access to the Tenant Allow/Block List, you need to be a
member of one of the following role groups:
*** *Global Reader* role group
*** *Security Reader* role group
*** *View-Only configuration* role group
+
For more information, see
link:/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo[Permissions in Exchange
Online].
+
*Notes*:
** Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the
Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions _and_
permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information,
see link:../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md[About admin roles].
** The *View-Only Organization Management* role group in
link:/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups[Exchange
Online] also gives read-only access to the feature.

=== Create block entries for files

You have the following options to create block entries for files:

* link:#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-files-in-the-submissions-portal[The
Submissions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal]
* The Tenant Allow/Block List in
link:#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-create-block-entries-for-files-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list[the
Microsoft 365 Defender portal] or in
link:#use-powershell-to-create-block-entries-for-files-in-the-tenant-allowblock-list[PowerShell]

==== Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for files in the Submissions portal

When you use the Submissions portal at
https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission to report files as
*Should have been blocked (False negative)*, you can select *Block this
file* to add a block entry on the *Files* tab in the Tenant Allow/Block
List.

For instructions, see
link:admin-submission.md#report-questionable-email-attachments-to-microsoft[Report
questionable email attachments to Microsoft].

==== Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create block entries for files in the Tenant Allow/Block List

You can create block entries for files directly in the Tenant
Allow/Block List.

Email messages that contain these blocked files are blocked as
_malware_.

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Policies & rules* > *Threat
Policies* > *Rules* section > *Tenant Allow/Block Lists*. Or, to go
directly to the *Tenant Allow/Block List* page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList.
. On the *Tenant Allow/Block List* page, select the *Files* tab.
. On the *Files* tab, click
image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png[Block icon.] *Block*.
. In the *Block files* flyout that appears, configure the following
settings:
* *Add file hashes*: Enter one SHA256 hash value per line, up to a
maximum of 20.
* *Remove block entry after*: The default value is *30 days*, but you
can select from the following values:
** *1 day*
** *7 days*
** *30 days*
** *Never expire*
** *Specific date*: The maximum value is 90 days from today.
* *Optional note*: Enter descriptive text for the entries.
. When you’re finished, click *Add*.

===== Use PowerShell to create block entries for files in the Tenant Allow/Block List

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType <FileHash> -Block -Entries "Value1","Value2",..."ValueN" <-ExpirationDate Date | -NoExpiration> [-Notes <String>]
----

This example adds a block entry for the specified files that never
expires.

[source,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType FileHash -Block -Entries "768a813668695ef2483b2bde7cf5d1b2db0423a0d3e63e498f3ab6f2eb13ea3","2c0a35409ff0873cfa28b70b8224e9aca2362241c1f0ed6f622fef8d4722fd9a" -NoExpiration
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistitems[New-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

=== Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to create allow entries for files in the Submissions portal

You can’t create allow entries for files directly in the Tenant
Allow/Block List. Instead, you use the Submissions portal at
https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission to report the message
attachment as a false positive, which also adds an allow entry on the
*Files* tab in the Tenant Allow/Block List.

For instructions, see
link:admin-submission.md#report-good-email-attachments-to-microsoft[Report
good email attachments to Microsoft].

____
[!IMPORTANT] Because Microsoft manages allow entries for you, unneeded
allow entries for files will be removed. This behavior protects your
organization and helps prevent misconfigured allow entries. If you
disagree with the verdict, you might need to open a support case to help
determine why a file is still considered bad.
