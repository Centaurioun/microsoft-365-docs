If link:air-about-office.md[automated investigation and response (AIR)
capabilities in Office 365] missed or wrongly detected something, there
are steps your security operations team can take to fix it. Such actions
include:

* link:#report-a-false-positivenegative-to-microsoft-for-analysis[Reporting
a false positive/negative to Microsoft];
* link:#adjust-an-alert-to-prevent-false-positives-from-recurring[Adjusting
alerts] (if needed); and
* link:#undo-a-remediation-action[Undoing remediation actions that were
taken].

Use this article as a guide.

=== Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft for analysis

If AIR in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 missed an email message, an
email attachment, a URL in an email message, or a URL in an Office file,
you can link:submissions-admin.md[submit suspected spam&#44; phish&#44; URLs&#44;
and files to Microsoft for Office 365 scanning].

You can also https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission[Submit a file
to Microsoft for malware analysis].

=== Adjust an alert to prevent false positives from recurring

If an alert is triggered by legitimate use, or the alert is inaccurate,
you can link:/cloud-app-security/managing-alerts[Manage alerts in the
Defender for Cloud Apps portal].

If your organization is using
link:/windows/security/threat-protection[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint] in addition to Office 365, and a file, IP address, URL, or
domain is treated as malware on a device, even though it’s safe, you can
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/manage-indicators[create
a custom indicator with an ``Allow'' action for your device].

=== Undo a remediation action

In most cases, if a remediation action was taken on an email message,
email attachment, or URL, and the item is actually not a threat, your
security operations team can undo the remediation action and take steps
to prevent the false positive from recurring. You can either use
link:#undo-an-action-using-threat-explorer[Threat Explorer] or the
link:#undo-an-action-in-the-action-center[Actions tab for an
investigation] to undo an action.
