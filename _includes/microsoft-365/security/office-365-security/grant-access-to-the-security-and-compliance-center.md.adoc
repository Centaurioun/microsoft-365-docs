Users need to be assigned permissions in the Security & Compliance Center before they can manage any of its security or compliance features.
As a global admin or member of the OrganizationManagement role group in the Security & Compliance Center, you can give these permissions to users.
Users will only be able to manage the security or compliance features that you give them access to.

For more information about the different permissions you can give to users in the Security & Compliance Center, check out xref:permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.adoc[Permissions in the Security & Compliance Center].

. In the role group's properties page under *Members*, click *Add*image:../../media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif[Add Icon.] and select the name of the user (or users) you want to add.
. When you've selected all of the users you want to add to the role group, click *add\->* and then *OK*.

=== Use Security & Compliance PowerShell to give another user access to the Security & Compliance Center

. link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell].
. Use the following syntax:
+
[,powershell]
----
Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity <RoleGroup> -Member <UserIdentity>
