*Applies to*

* xref:exchange-online-protection-overview.adoc[Exchange Online Protection]
* xref:defender-for-office-365.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2]
* xref:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender]

When messages can't be sent from your organization to your on-premises or partner email servers using connectors, the messages are queued in Microsoft 365.
Common examples that cause this condition are:

* The connector is incorrectly configured.
* There have been networking or firewall changes in your on-premises environment.

Microsoft 365 will continue to retry to delivery for 24 hours.
After 24 hours, the messages will expire and will be returned to the senders in non-delivery reports (also known as a NDRs or bounce messages).

If the queued email volume exceeds the pre-defined threshold (the default value is 200 messages), the information is available in the following locations:

* The *Queues* insight in the xref:mail-flow-insights-v2.adoc[Mail flow dashboard] in the https://protection.office.com[Security & Compliance Center].
For more information, see the <<queues-insight-in-the-mail-flow-dashboard,Queues insight in the Mail flow dashboard>> section in this article.
* An alert is displayed in *Recent alerts* the Alerts dashboard in the https://protection.office.com[Security & Compliance Center] (*Alerts* > *Dashboard* or https://protection.office.com/alertsdashboard).

=== Queues insight in the Mail flow dashboard

Even if the queued message volume hasn't exceeded the threshold and generated an alert, you can still use the *Queues* insight in the xref:mail-flow-insights-v2.adoc[Mail flow dashboard] to see messages that have been queued for more than one hour, and take action before the number of queued messages becomes too large.

* *Queue started time*
