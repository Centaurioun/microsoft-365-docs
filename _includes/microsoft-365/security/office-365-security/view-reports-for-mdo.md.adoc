=== Mail latency report

The *Mail latency report* shows you an aggregate view of the mail delivery and detonation latency experienced within your organization.
Mail delivery times in the service are affected by a number of factors, and the absolute delivery time in seconds is often not a good indicator of success or a problem.
A slow delivery time on one day might be considered an average delivery time on another day, or vice-versa.
This tries to qualify message delivery based on statistical data about the observed delivery times of other messages.

Client side and network latency are not included.

To view the report, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to *Reports* > *Email & collaboration* > *Email & collaboration reports*.
To go directly to the *Email & collaboration reports* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/emailandcollabreport.

On the *Email & collaboration reports* page, find *Mail latency report* and then click *View details*.
To go directly to the report, use https://security.microsoft.com/mailLatencyReport.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mail-latency-report-widget.png" alt-text="The Mail latency report widget on the Email & collaboration reports page" lightbox="../../media/mail-latency-report-widget.png":::

On the *Mail latency report* page, the following tabs are available on the *Mail latency report* page:

* *50th percentile*: This is the middle for message delivery times.
You can consider this value as an average delivery time.
This tab is selected by default.
* *90th percentile*: This indicates a high latency for message delivery.
Only 10% of messages took longer than this value to deliver.
* *99th percentile*: This indicates the highest latency for message delivery.

Regardless of the tab you select, the chart shows messages organized into the following categories:

* *Overall*
* *Detonation*

When you hover over a category in the chart, you can see a breakdown of the latency in each category.
