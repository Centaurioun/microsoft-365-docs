== Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 together with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.adoc[MDO Trial banner]]

xref:defender-for-office-365.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Office 365] can be configured to work with link:/windows/security/threat-protection[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint].

Integrating Microsoft Defender for Office 365 with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can help your security operations team monitor and take action quickly if users' devices are at risk.
For example, once integration is enabled, your security operations team will be able to see the devices that are potentially affected by a detected email message, as well as how many recent alerts were generated for those devices in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

The following image depicts what the *Devices* tab looks like when you have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration enabled:

In this example, you can see that the recipients of the detected email message have four devices and one has an alert.
Clicking the link for a device opens its page in the link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
