{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for
Office 365 plan 2]

When an link:air-about.md[automated investigation] occurs in
link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for Office 365],
details about that investigation are available during and after the
automated investigation process. If you have the necessary permissions,
you can view those details in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
Investigation details provide you with up-to-date status, and the
ability to approve any pending actions.

[!TIP] Check out the new, unified investigation page in the Microsoft
365 Defender portal. To learn more, see

=== Investigation status

The investigation status indicates the progress of the analysis and
actions. As the investigation runs, status changes to indicate whether
threats were found, and whether actions have been approved.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Status |Description
|*Starting* |The investigation has been triggered and waiting to start
running.

|*Running* |The investigation process has started and is underway. This
state also occurs when
link:air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md#approve-or-reject-pending-actions[pending
actions] are approved.

|*No Threats Found* |The investigation has finished and no threats (user
account, email message, URL, or file) were identified.

|*Partially Investigated* |The automated investigation found issues, but
there are no specific remediation actions to resolve those issues.

|*Terminated By System* |The investigation stopped. An investigation can
stop for several reasons:

|*Pending Action* |The investigation has found a threat, such as a
malicious email, a malicious URL, or a risky mailbox setting, and an
action to remediate that threat is
link:air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md[awaiting approval].

|*Remediated* |The investigation finished and all remediation actions
were approved (noted as fully remediated).

|*Partially Remediated* |The investigation resulted in remediation
actions, and some were approved and completed. Other actions are still
link:air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md[pending].

|*Failed* |At least one investigation analyzer ran into a problem where
it couldn’t complete properly.

|*Queued By Throttling* |An investigation is being held in a queue. When
other investigations complete, queued investigations begin. Throttling
helps avoid poor service performance.

|*Terminated By Throttling* |If an investigation is held in the queue
too long, it stops.

=== View details of an investigation

[arabic]
. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
(https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in.
. In the navigation pane, select *Actions & submissions* > *Action
center*.
. On either the *Pending* or *History* tabs, select an action. Its
flyout pane opens.
. In the flyout pane, select *Open investigation page*.
. Use the various tabs to learn more about the investigation.

=== View details about an alert related to an investigation

Certain kinds of alerts trigger automated investigation in Microsoft
365. To learn more, see
link:air-about.md#which-alert-policies-trigger-automated-investigations[alert
policies that trigger automated investigations].

[arabic]
. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
(https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in.
. In the navigation pane, select *Action center*.
. On either the *Pending* or *History* tabs, select an action. Its
flyout pane opens.
. In the flyout pane, select *Open investigation page*.
. Select the *Alerts* tab to view a list of all of the alerts associated
with that investigation.
. Select an item in the list to open its flyout pane. There, you can
view more information about the alert.

=== Keep the following points in mind

* Email counts are calculated at the time of the investigation, and some
counts are recalculated when you open investigation flyouts (based on an
underlying query).
* The email counts shown for the email clusters on the *Email* tab and
the email quantity value shown on cluster flyout are calculated at the
time of investigation, and don’t change.
* The email count shown at the bottom of the *Email* tab of the email
cluster flyout and the count of email messages shown in Explorer reflect
email messages received after the investigation’s initial analysis.
+
Thus, an email cluster that shows an original quantity of 10 email
messages would show an email list total of 15 when five more email
messages arrive between the investigation analysis phase and when the
admin reviews the investigation. Likewise, old investigations might
start showing higher counts than Explorer queries show, because data in
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 expires after seven days for
trials and after 30 days for paid licenses.
+
Showing both count historical and current counts in different views is
done to indicate the email impact at the time of investigation and the
current impact up until the time that remediation is run.
* In the context of email, you might see a volume anomaly threat surface
as part of the investigation. A volume anomaly indicates a spike in
similar email messages around the investigation event time compared to
earlier timeframes. A spike in email traffic together with certain
characteristics (for example, subject and sender domain, body
similarity, and sender IP) is typical of the start of email campaigns or
attacks. However, bulk, spam, and legitimate email campaigns commonly
share these characteristics.
* Volume anomalies represent a potential threat, and accordingly could
be less severe compared to malware or phish threats that are identified
using anti-virus engines, detonation, or malicious reputation.
* You don’t have to approve every action. If you don’t agree with the
recommended action or your organization doesn’t choose certain types of
actions, then you can choose to *Reject* the actions or simply ignore
them and take no action.
* Approving and/or rejecting all actions lets the investigation fully
close (status becomes remediated), while leaving some actions incomplete
results in the investigation status changing to a partially remediated
state.
