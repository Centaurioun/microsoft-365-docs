== Admin review for reported messages

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.adoc[MDO Trial banner]]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes and Microsoft Defender for Office 365, admins can now send templated messages back to end users after they review reported messages.
The templates can be customized for your organization and based on your admin's verdict as well.

The feature is designed to give feedback to your users but doesn't change the verdicts of messages in the system.
To help Microsoft update and improve its filters, you need to submit messages for analysis using xref:admin-submission.adoc[Admin submission].

You will only be able to mark and notify users of review results if the message was reported as a xref:report-false-positives-and-false-negatives.adoc[false positives or false negatives].

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* You open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com.
To go directly to the *Submissions* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission.
* To modify the configuration for User submissions, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:
 ** Organization Management or Security Administrator in the xref:permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
 ** Organization Management in link:/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups[Exchange Online].
* You'll also need access to Exchange Online PowerShell.
If the account that you're trying to use doesn't have access to Exchange Online PowerShell, you'll receive an error that says _Specify an email address in your domain_.
For more information about enabling or disabling access to Exchange Online PowerShell, see the following topics:
 ** link:/powershell/exchange/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell[Enable or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell]
 ** link:/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/client-access-rules/client-access-rules[Client Access Rules in Exchange Online]

=== Notify users from within the portal

. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com, go to the *Submissions* page at *Email & collaboration* > *Submissions*.
To go directly to the *Submissions* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission.
