The Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protection or filtering stack can
be broken out into 4 phases, as in this article. Generally speaking,
incoming mail passes through all of these phases before delivery, but
the actual path email takes is subject to an organization’s Defender for
Office 365 configuration.

[!TIP] Stay tuned till the end of this article for a _unified_ graphic
of all 4 phases of Defender for Office 365 protection!
____

=== Phase 1 - Edge Protection

Unfortunately, Edge blocks that were once _critical_ are now relatively
simple for bad actors to overcome. Over time, less traffic is blocked
here, but it remains an important part of the stack.

Edge blocks are designed to be automatic. In the case of false positive,
senders will be notified and told how to address their issue. Connectors
from trusted partners with limited reputation can ensure deliverability,
or temporary overrides can be put in place, when onboarding new
endpoints.

[arabic]
. *Network throttling* protects Office 365 infrastructure and customers
from Denial of Service (DOS) attacks by limiting the number of messages
that can be submitted by a specific set of infrastructure.
. *IP reputation and throttling* will block messages being sent from
known bad connecting IP addresses. If a specific IP sends many messages
in a short period of time they will be throttled.
. *Domain reputation* will block any messages being sent from a known
bad domain.
. *Directory-based edge filtering* blocks attempts to harvest an
organization’s directory information through SMTP.
. *Backscatter detection* prevents an organization from being attacked
through invalid non-delivery reports (NDRs).
. *Enhanced filtering for connectors* preserves authentication
information even when traffic passes through another device before it
reaches Office 365. This improves filtering stack accuracy, including
heuristic clustering, anti-spoofing, and anti-phishing machine learning
models, even when in complex or hybrid routing scenarios.

=== Phase 2 - Sender Intelligence

Features in sender intelligence are critical for catching spam, bulk,
impersonation, and unauthorized spoof messages, and also factor into
phish detection. Most of these features are individually configurable.

alt-text=``Phase 2 of filtering in Defender for Office 365 is Sender
intelligence''
lightbox=``../../media/mdo-filtering-stack/mdo-filter-stack-phase2.png'':::

[arabic]
. *Account compromise detection* triggers and alerts are raised when an
account has anomalous behavior, consistent with compromise. In some
cases, the user account is blocked and prevented from sending any
further email messages until the issue is resolved by an organization’s
security operations team.
. *Email Authentication* involves both customer configured methods and
methods set up in the Cloud, aimed at ensuring that senders are
authorized, authentic mailers. These methods resist spoofing.
* *SPF* can reject mails based on DNS TXT records that list IP addresses
and servers allowed to send mail on the organization’s behalf.
* *DKIM* provides an encrypted signature that authenticates the sender.
* *DMARC* lets admins mark SPF and DKIM as required in their domain and
enforces alignment between the results of these two technologies.
* *ARC* builds on DMARC to work with forwarding in mailing lists while
recording an authentication chain.
. *Spoof intelligence* is capable of filtering those allowed to `spoof'
(that is, those sending mail on behalf of another account, or forwarding
for a mailing list) from malicious senders who imitate organizational or
known external domains. It separates legitimate `on behalf of' mail from
senders who spoof to deliver spam and phishing messages.
+
*Intra-org spoof intelligence* detects and blocks spoof attempts from a
domain within the organization.
. *Cross-domain spoof intelligence* detects and blocks spoof attempts
from a domain outside of the organization.
. *Bulk filtering* lets admins configure a bulk confidence level (BCL)
indicating whether the message was sent from a bulk sender.
Administrators can use the Bulk Slider in the Antispam policy to decide
what level of bulk mail to treat as spam.
. *Mailbox intelligence* learns from standard user email behaviors. It
leverages a user’s communication graph to detect when a sender only
appears to be someone the user usually communicates with, but is
actually malicious. This method detects impersonation.
. *Mailbox intelligence impersonation* enables or disables enhanced
impersonation results based on each user’s individual sender map. When
enabled, this feature helps to identify impersonation.
. *User impersonation* allows an admin to create a list of high value
targets likely to be impersonated. If a mail arrives where the sender
only appears to have the same name and address as the protected high
value account, the mail is marked or tagged. (For example,
_trαcye@contoso.com_ for _tracye@contoso.com_).
. *Domain impersonation* detects domains that are similar to the
recipient’s domain and that attempt to look like an internal domain. For
example, this impersonation _tracye@liwαre.com_ for
_tracye@litware.com_.

=== Phase 3 - Content Filtering

In this phase the filtering stack begins to handle the specific contents
of the mail, including its hyperlinks and attachments.

alt-text=``The Phase-3 filtering in MDO is Content Filtering''
lightbox=``../../media/mdo-filtering-stack/mdo-filter-stack-phase3.png'':::

[arabic]
. *Transport rules* (also known as mail flow rules or Exchange transport
rules) allow an admin to take a wide range of actions when an equally
wide range of conditions are met for a message. All messages that flow
through your organization are evaluated against the enabled mail flow
rules / transport rules.
. *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* and a _third-party Antivirus engine_
are used to detect all known malware in attachments.
. The anti-virus (AV) engines are also used to true-type supported
attachment types, which allows *Type blocking* to correctly block file
types specified by admins.
. Whenever Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects a malicious
attachment, the file’s hash, and a hash of its active content, are added
to Exchange Online Protection (EOP) reputation. *Attachment reputation
blocking* will block that file across all Office 365, and on endpoints,
through MSAV cloud calls.
. *Heuristic clustering* can determine that a file is suspicious based
on delivery heuristics. When a suspicious attachment is found, the
entire campaign pauses, and the file is sandboxed. If the file is found
to be malicious, the entire campaign is blocked.
. *Machine learning models* act on the header, body content, and URLs of
a message to detect phishing attempts.
. Microsoft uses a determination of reputation from URL sandboxing as
well as URL reputation from third party feeds in *URL reputation
blocking*, to block any message with a known malicious URL.
. *Content heuristics* can detect suspicious messages based on structure
and word frequency within the body of the message, using machine
learning models.
. *Safe Attachments* sandboxes every attachment for Defender for Office
365 customers, using dynamic analysis to detect never-before seen
threats.
. *Linked content detonation* treats every URL linking to a file in an
email as an attachment, asynchronously sandboxing the file at the time
of delivery.
. *URL Detonation* happens when upstream anti-phishing technology finds
a message or URL to be suspicious. URL detonation sandboxes the URLs in
the message at the time of delivery.

=== Phase 4 - Post-Delivery Protection

The last stage takes place after mail or file delivery, acting on mail
that is in various mailboxes and files and links that appear in clients
like Microsoft Teams.

alt-text=``The Phase-4 filtering in Defender for Office 365 is
Post-delivery protection''
lightbox=``../../media/mdo-filtering-stack/mdo-filter-stack-phase4.png'':::

[arabic]
. *Safe Links* is Defender for Office 365’s time-of-click protection.
Every URL in every message is wrapped to point to Microsoft Safe Links
servers. When a URL is clicked it is checked against the latest
reputation, before the user is redirected to the target site. The URL is
asynchronously sandboxed to update its reputation.
. *Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) for phishing* retroactively detects and
neutralizes malicious phishing messages that have already been delivered
to Exchange Online mailboxes.
. *ZAP for malware* retroactively detects and neutralizes malicious
malware messages that have already been delivered to Exchange Online
mailboxes.
. *ZAP for spam* retroactively detects and neutralizes malicious spam
messages that have already been delivered to Exchange Online mailboxes.
. *Campaign Views* let administrators see the big picture of an attack,
faster and more completely, than any team could without automation.
Microsoft leverages the vast amounts of anti-phishing, anti-spam, and
anti-malware data across the entire service to help identify campaigns,
and then allows admins to investigate them from start to end, including
targets, impacts, and flows, that are also available in a downloadable
campaign write-up.
. *The Report Message add-ins* enable people to easily report false
positives (good email, mistakenly marked as _bad_) or false negatives
(bad email marked as _good_) to Microsoft for further analysis.
. *Safe Links for Office clients* offers the same Safe Links
time-of-click protection, natively, inside supported Office apps like
Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.
. *Protection for OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams* offers the same Safe
Attachments protection against malicious files, natively, inside of
OneDrive, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.
. When a URL that points to a file is selected post delivery, *linked
content detonation* displays a warning page until the sandboxing of the
file is complete, and the URL is found to be safe.
