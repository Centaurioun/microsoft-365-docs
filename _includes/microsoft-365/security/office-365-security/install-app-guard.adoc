Alternatively, you can set the corresponding CSP policy:
+
____
OMA-URI:
*./Device/Vendor/MSFT/WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard/Settings/AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard*
Data type: *Integer* Value: *2*
____
. Restart the system.

==== Set Diagnostics & feedback to send full data

____
[!NOTE] This is not required, however, configuring optional diagnostics
data will help diagnose reported issues.
____

This step ensures that the data necessary to identify and fix problems
is reaching Microsoft. Follow these steps to enable diagnostics on your
Windows device:

[arabic]
. Open *Settings* from the Start menu.
. On *Windows Settings*, select *Privacy*.
. Under Privacy, select *Diagnostics & feedback* and select *Optional
diagnostic data*.

For more on configuring Windows diagnostic settings, refer to
link:/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#enterprise-management[Configuring
Windows diagnostic data in your organization].

==== Confirm that Application Guard for Office is enabled and working

Before confirming that Application Guard for Office is enabled: 1.
Launch Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on a device where the policies have
been deployed. 2. From the app you launched, go to *File -> Account*. On
the Account page, verify that the expected license is shown.

To confirm that Application Guard for Office is enabled, open an
untrusted document. For example, you can open a document that was
downloaded from the internet or an email attachment from someone outside
your organization.

When you first open an untrusted file, you see an Office splash screen
like the following example. Application Guard for Office is being
activated and the file is being opened. Subsequent openings of untrusted
files are typically faster.

:::image type=``content'' source=``../../media/ag08-confirm.png''
alt-text=``The Office app splash page''
lightbox=``../../media/ag08-confirm.png'':::

After the file opens, there are a few visual indicators that signal that
the file is open inside Application Guard for Office:

* A callout in the ribbon

=== Configure Application Guard for Office

Office supports the following policies to configure Application Guard
for Office. These policies can be configured through group policies or
through the
link:/DeployOffice/overview-office-cloud-policy-service[Office cloud
policy service].

____
[!NOTE] Configuring these policies can disable some functionality for
files opened in Application Guard for Office.
____

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Policy |Description
|Don’t use Application Guard for Office |Enabling this policy forces
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to use the Protected View isolation
container instead of Application Guard for Office.

|Configure Application Guard for Office container pre-creation |This
policy determines if the Application Guard for Office container is
pre-created for improved run-time performance. When you enable this
policy, you can specify the number of days to continue pre-creating a
container or let the Office built-in heuristic pre-create the container.

|Don’t allow copy/paste for Office documents opened in Application Guard
for Office |Enabling this policy prevents a user from copying and
pasting content from a document opened in Application Guard for Office
to a document opened outside of the container.

|Disable hardware acceleration in Application Guard for Office |This
policy controls whether Application Guard for Office uses hardware
acceleration to render graphics. If you enable this setting, Application
Guard for Office uses software-based (CPU) rendering and won’t load any
third-party graphics drivers or interact with any connected graphics
hardware.

|Disable unsupported file types protection in Application Guard for
Office |This policy controls whether Application Guard for Office will
block unsupported file types from being opened or if it will enable the
redirection to Protected View.

|Turn off camera and microphone access for documents opened in
Application Guard for Office |Enabling this policy removes Office access
to the camera and microphone inside Application Guard for Office.

|Restrict printing from documents opened in Application Guard for Office
|Enabling this policy limits the printers that a user can print to from
a file opened in Application Guard for Office. For example, you can use
this policy to restrict users to only print to PDF.

|Prevent users from removing Application Guard for Office protection on
files |Enabling this policy removes the option (within the Office
application experience) to disable Application Guard for Office
protection or to open a file outside Application Guard for Office.

=== Integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Application Guard for Office is integrated with Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint to provide monitoring and alerting on malicious activity that
happens in the isolated environment.

link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-documents-in-e5-plus-security-about[Safe
Documents in Microsoft E365 E5] is a feature that uses Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint to scan documents opened in Application Guard for
Office. For an additional layer of protection, users can’t leave
Application Guard for Office until the results of the scan have been
determined.

=== Limitations and considerations

* Application Guard for Office is a protected mode that isolates
untrusted documents so that they can’t access trusted corporate
resources, an intranet, the user’s identity, and arbitrary files on the
computer. As a result, if a user tries to access a feature that has a
dependency on such access—for example, inserting a picture from a local
file on disk—the access fails and displays a prompt like the following
example. To enable an untrusted document to access trusted resources,
users must remove Application Guard protection from the document.
+
:::image type=``content'' source=``../../media/ag09-confirm.png''
alt-text=``The Dialog box stating safety message and the feature
status'' lightbox=``../../media/ag09-confirm.png'':::
+
____
[!NOTE] Advise users to only remove protection if they trust the file
and the source of the file.
____
* Active content like macros and ActiveX controls are disabled in
Application Guard for Office. To enable active content, the Application
Guard protection must be removed.
* Untrusted files from network shares or files shared from OneDrive,
OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online open as read-only in
Application Guard. Users can save a local copy of such files to continue
working in the container or remove protection to directly work with the
original file.
* Files that are protected by Information Rights Management (IRM) are
blocked by default. If users want to open such files in Protected View,
an administrator must configure policy settings for unsupported file
types for the organization.
* Any customizations to Office applications in Application Guard for
Office do not persist after a user signs out and signs in again or after
the device restarts.
* Only Accessibility tools that use the UIA framework can provide an
accessible experience for files opened in Application Guard for Office.
* Network connectivity is required for the first launch of Application
Guard after installation.
* In the document’s info section, the _Last Modified By_ property may
display *WDAGUtilityAccount* as the user. WDAGUtilityAccount is the
anonymous account used by Application Guard. The desktop user’s identity
isn’t available inside the Application Guard container.

=== Performance optimizations for Application Guard for Office

Application Guard uses a virtualized container, similar to a virtual
machine, to isolate untrusted documents away from the system. The
process of creating a container and setting up the Application Guard
container to open Office documents has a performance overhead that might
negatively affect user experience when users open an untrusted document.

To provide users with the expected file-opening experience, Application
Guard uses logic to pre-create a container when the following heuristic
is met on a system: A user has opened a file in either Protected View or
Application Guard in the past 28 days.

When this heuristic is met, Office will pre-create an Application Guard
container for the user after they sign in to Windows. While this
pre-create operation is in progress, the system may experience slow
performance, but the effect will resolve as soon as the operation
completes.

____
[!NOTE] The hints needed for the heuristic to pre-create the container
are generated by Office applications as a user uses them. If a user
installs Office on a new system where Application Guard is enabled,
Office will not pre-create the container until after the first time a
user opens an untrusted document on the system. The user will observe
that this first file takes longer to open in Application Guard.
____

=== Known issues

* Selecting web links (`http` or `https`) doesn’t open the browser.
* The default setting for copy-paste protection policy is to enable
clipboard access to text only.
* The default setting for unsupported file types protection policy is to
block opening untrusted unsupported file types that are encrypted or
have Information Rights Management (IRM) set. This includes files that
are encrypted by using sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview
Information Protection.
* CSV and HTML files are not supported at this time.
* Application Guard for Office currently does not work with NTFS
compressed volumes. If you are seeing an error
``ERROR_VIRTUAL_DISK_LIMITATION'' please try uncompressing the volume.
* Updates to .NET might cause files to fail to open in Application
Guard. As a workaround, users can restart their device when they come
across this failure. Learn more about the issue at
https://support.microsoft.com/help/4575917/receiving-an-error-message-when-attempting-to-open-windows-defender-ap[Receiving
