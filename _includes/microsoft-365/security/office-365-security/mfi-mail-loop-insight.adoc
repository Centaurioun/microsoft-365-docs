Mail loops are bad because:

* They waste system resources.
* They consume your organization’s mail volume quota.
* They send confusing non-delivery reports (also known as NDRs or bounce
messages) to the original message senders.

The *Fix possible mail loop* insight in the *Recommended for you* area
of the link:mail-flow-insights-v2.md[Mail flow dashboard] in the
https://protection.office.com[Security & Compliance Center] notifies you
when a mail loop is detected in your organization.

This insight appears only after the condition is detected (if you don’t
have any mail loops, you won’t see the insight).
