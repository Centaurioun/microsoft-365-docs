*Applies to:* - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for
Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2] -
link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender]

User tags are identifiers for specific groups of users in
link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for Office 365].
There are two types of user tags:

* *System tags*: Currently,
link:../../admin/setup/priority-accounts.md[Priority accounts] is the
only type of system tag.
* *Custom tags*: You create these user tags yourself.

If your organization has Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 (included in
your subscription or as an add-on), you can create custom user tags in
addition to using the priority accounts tag.

____
[!NOTE] Currently, you can only apply user tags to mailbox users.
____

After you apply system tags or custom tags to users, you can use those
tags as filters in alerts, reports, and investigations:
