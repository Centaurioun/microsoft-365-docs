[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.adoc[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to*

* xref:defender-for-office-365.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2]
* xref:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender]

=== Remediation actions

Threat protection features in xref:defender-for-office-365.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Office 365] include certain remediation actions.
Such remediation actions can include:

* Soft delete email messages or clusters
* Block URL (time-of-click)
* Turn off external mail forwarding
* Turn off delegation

In Microsoft Defender for Office 365, remediation actions are not taken automatically.
Instead, remediation actions are taken only upon approval by your organization's security operations team.

=== Threats and remediation actions

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 includes remediation actions to address various threats.
Automated investigations often result in one or more remediation actions to review and approve.
In some cases, an automated investigation does not result in a specific remediation action.
To further investigate and take appropriate actions, use the guidance in the following table.

|===
| Category | Threat/risk | Remediation action(s)

| Email
| Malware
| Soft delete email/cluster <p> If more than a handful of email messages in a cluster contain malware, the cluster is considered to be malicious.

| Email
| Malicious URL + (A malicious URL was detected by xref:safe-links.adoc[Safe Links].)
| Soft delete email/cluster + Block URL (time-of-click verification) <p> Email that contains a malicious URL is considered to be malicious.

| Email
| Phish
| Soft delete email/cluster <p> If more than a handful of email messages in a cluster contain phishing attempts, the whole cluster is considered a phishing attempt.

| Email
| Zapped phish + (Email messages were delivered and then xref:zero-hour-auto-purge.adoc[zapped].)
| Soft delete email/cluster <p> Reports are available to view zapped messages.
link:zero-hour-auto-purge.md#how-to-see-if-zap-moved-your-message[See if ZAP moved a message and FAQs].

| Email
| Missed phish email xref:enable-the-report-message-add-in.adoc[reported] by a user
| link:automated-investigation-response-office.md#example-a-user-reported-phish-message-launches-an-investigation-playbook[Automated investigation triggered by the user's report]

| Email
| Volume anomaly + (Recent email quantities exceed the previous 7-10 days for matching criteria.)
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p>Volume anomaly is not a clear threat, but is merely an indication of larger email volumes in recent days compared to the last 7-10 days.
<p>Although a high volume of email can indicate potential issues, confirmation is needed in terms of either malicious verdicts or a manual review of email messages/clusters.
See link:investigate-malicious-email-that-was-delivered.md#find-suspicious-email-that-was-delivered[Find suspicious email that was delivered].

| Email
| No threats found + (The system did not find any threats based on files, URLs, or analysis of email cluster verdicts.)
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p>Threats found and xref:zero-hour-auto-purge.adoc[zapped] after an investigation is complete are not reflected in an investigation's numerical findings, but such threats are viewable in xref:threat-explorer.adoc[Threat Explorer].

| User
| A user clicked a malicious URL + (A user navigated to a page that was later found to be malicious, or a user bypassed a link:safe-links.md#warning-pages-from-safe-links[Safe Links warning page] to get to a malicious page.)
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p> Block URL (time-of-click) <p> Use Threat Explorer to link:threat-explorer.md#view-phishing-url-and-click-verdict-data[view data about URLs and click verdicts].
<p> If your organization is using link:/windows/security/threat-protection/[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint], consider link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/investigate-user[investigating the user] to determine if their account is compromised.

| User
| A user is sending malware/phish
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p> The user might be reporting malware/phish, or someone could be xref:anti-spoofing-protection.adoc[spoofing the user] as part of an attack.
Use xref:threat-explorer.adoc[Threat Explorer] to view and handle email containing link:threat-explorer-views.md#email--malware[malware] or link:threat-explorer-views.md#email--phish[phish].

| User
| Email forwarding + (Mailbox forwarding rules are configured, chch could be used for data exfiltration.)
| Remove forwarding rule <p> Use xref:mail-flow-insights-v2.adoc[mail flow insights], including the xref:mfi-auto-forwarded-messages-report.adoc[Autofowarded messages report], to view more specific details about forwarded email.

| User
| Email delegation rules + (A user's account has delegations set up.)
| Remove delegation rule <p> If your organization is using link:/windows/security/threat-protection/[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint], consider link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/investigate-user[investigating the user] who's getting the delegation permission.

| User
| Data exfiltration + (A user violated email or file-sharing xref:../../compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp.adoc[DLP policies]
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p> xref:../../compliance/view-the-dlp-reports.adoc[View DLP reports and take action].

| User
| Anomalous email sending + (A user recently sent more email than during the previous 7-10 days.)
| Automated investigation does not result in a specific pending action.
<p> Sending a large volume of email isn't malicious by itself;
the user might just have sent email to a large group of recipients for an event.
To investigate, use xref:mail-flow-insights-v2.adoc[mail flow insights], including the xref:mfi-mail-flow-map-report.adoc[mail flow map report] to determine what's going on and take action.
