Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 trial user guide! This
user guide will help you make the most of your free trial by teaching
you how to safeguard your organization against malicious threats posed
by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools.

=== What is Defender for Office 365?

Defender for Office 365 helps organizations secure their enterprise by
offering a comprehensive slate of capabilities including threat
protection policies, reports, threat investigation and response
capabilities and automated investigation and response capabilities.

==== Audit mode vs. blocking mode for Defender for Office 365

Do you want your Defender for Office 365 experience to be active or
passive? These are the two modes that you can select from:

* *Audit mode*: Special _evaluation policies_ are created for
anti-phishing (which includes impersonation protection), Safe
Attachments, and Safe Links. These evaluation policies are configured to
_detect_ threats only. Defender for Office 365 detects harmful messages
for reporting, but the messages aren’t acted upon (for example, detected
messages aren’t quarantined). The settings of these evaluation policies
are described in the
link:try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#policies-in-audit-mode[Policies
in audit mode] section later in this article.
+
Audit mode provides access to customized reports for threats detected by
Defender for Office 365 on the *Evaluation mode* page at
https://security.microsoft.com/atpEvaluation.
* *Blocking mode*: The Standard template for
link:preset-security-policies.md[preset security policies] is turned on
and used for the trial, and the users you specify to include in the
trial are added to the Standard preset security policy. Defender for
Office 365 _detects_ and _takes action on_ harmful messages (for
example, detected messages are quarantined).
+
The default and recommended selection is to scope these Defender for
Office 365 policies to all users in the organization. But during or
after the setup of your trial, you can change the policy assignment to
specific users, groups, or email domains in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal or in
link:try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#policy-settings-associated-with-defender-for-office-365-trials[Policy
settings associated with Defender for Office 365 trials]
+
Blocking mode does not provide customized reports for threats detected
by Defender for Office 365. Instead, the information is available in the
regular reports and investigation features of Defender for Office 365
Plan 2.

A key factor in audit mode vs. blocking mode is how email is delivered
to your Microsoft 365 organization:

* Mail from the internet flows directly Microsoft 365, but your current
subscription has only link:eop-about.md[Exchange Online Protection
(EOP)] or
link:overview.md#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet[Defender
for Office 365 Plan 1].
+
image::../../media/mdo-trial-mail-flow.png[Mail flows from the internet
into Microsoft 365, with protection from EOP and/or Defender for Office
365 Plan 1.]
+
In these environments, you can select *audit mode* or *blocking mode*.
* You’re currently using a third-party service or device for email
protection of your Microsoft 365 mailboxes. Mail from the internet flows
through the protection service before delivery into your Microsoft 365
organization. Microsoft 365 protection is as low as possible (it’s never
completely off; for example, malware protection is always enforced).
+
image::../../media/mdo-migration-before.png[Mail flows from the internet
through the third-party protection service or device before delivery
into Microsoft 365.]
+
In these environments, you can select *audit mode* only. You don’t need
to change your mail flow (MX records).

Let’s get started!

=== Blocking mode

==== Step 1: Getting started in blocking mode

===== Start your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 trial

After you’ve initiated the trial and completed the
link:try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md#set-up-an-evaluation-or-trial-in-blocking-mode[setup
process], it may take up to 2 hours for changes to take effect.

We’ve automatically configured link:preset-security-policies.md[Preset
security policies] in your environment. These policies represent a
baseline protection profile that’s suitable for most users. Standard
protection includes:

* Safe Links, Safe Attachments and anti-phishing policies that are
scoped to the entire tenant or subset of users you may have chosen
during the trial setup process.
* Safe Attachments protection for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft
Teams.
* Safe Links protection for supported Office 365 apps.

already pay for), and a mature product with integrated security
protection.
