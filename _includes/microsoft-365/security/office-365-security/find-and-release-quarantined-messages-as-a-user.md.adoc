_Quarantine policies_ define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined in link:quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features[supported features].
Default quarantine policies enforce the historical capabilities as described in the previous table.
Admins can create and apply custom quarantine policies that define less restrictive or more restrictive capabilities for users in supported features.
For more information, see xref:quarantine-policies.adoc[Quarantine policies].

You view and manage your quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or (if an admin has set this up) quarantine notifications from quarantine policies.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to https://security.microsoft.com.
To go directly to the *Quarantine* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine.
* Admins can configure how long messages are kept in quarantine before they're permanently deleted in anti-spam policies.
Messages that have expired from quarantine are unrecoverable.
For more information, see xref:configure-your-spam-filter-policies.adoc[Configure anti-spam policies in EOP].
* By default, messages that were quarantined for high confidence phishing, malware, or by mail flow rules are only available to admins, and aren't visible to users.
For more information, see xref:manage-quarantined-messages-and-files.adoc[Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP].
