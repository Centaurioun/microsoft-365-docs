There are valid business reasons to forward email messages to external recipients in specific domains.
However, it's suspicious when users in your organization suddenly start forwarding messages to a domain where no one in your organization has ever forwarded messages to (a new domain).

This condition might indicate that the user accounts are compromised.
If you suspect the accounts have been compromised, see xref:responding-to-a-compromised-email-account.adoc[Responding to a compromised email account].

The *New domains being forwarded email* insight in the https://protection.office.com[Security & Compliance Center] notifies you when users in your organization are forwarding messages to new domains.

This insight appears only when the issue is detected, and it appears on the link:view-mail-flow-reports.md#forwarding-report[Forwarding report] page.

When you click on the widget, a flyout appears where you can find more details about the forwarded messages, including a link back to the link:view-mail-flow-reports.md#forwarding-report[Forwarding report].

You can also get to this details page when you select the insight after you click *View all* in the *Top insights & recommendations* area on (*Reports* > *Dashboard* or https://protection.office.com/insightdashboard).

To prevent automatic message forwarding to external domains, configure a remote domain for some or all external domains.
