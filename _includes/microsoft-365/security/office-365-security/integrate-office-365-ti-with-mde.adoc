== Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 together with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for Office 365] can
be configured to work with
link:/windows/security/threat-protection[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint].

Integrating Microsoft Defender for Office 365 with Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint can help your security operations team monitor and take
action quickly if users’ devices are at risk. For example, once
integration is enabled, your security operations team will be able to
see the devices that are potentially affected by a detected email
message, as well as how many recent alerts were generated for those
devices in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

The following image depicts what the *Devices* tab looks like when you
have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration enabled:

alt-text=``A list of devices with alerts''
lightbox=``../../media/fec928ea-8f0c-44d7-80b9-a2e0a8cd4e89.PNG'':::

In this example, you can see that the recipients of the detected email
message have four devices and one has an alert. Clicking the link for a
device opens its page in the
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender[Microsoft
365 Defender portal].

[!TIP] The Microsoft 365 Defender portal replaces the Microsoft Defender
Security Center. See
