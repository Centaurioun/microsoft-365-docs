== Manage quarantined messages and files as an admin in EOP

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:exchange-online-protection-overview.md[Exchange
Online Protection] - link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender
for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2] -
link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or
standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without
Exchange Online mailboxes, quarantine holds potentially dangerous or
unwanted messages. For more information, see
link:quarantine-email-messages.md[Quarantined email messages in EOP].

Admins can view, release, and delete all types of quarantined messages
for all users. Admins can also report false positives to Microsoft.

By default, only admins can manage messages that were quarantined as
malware, high confidence phishing, or as a result of mail flow rules
(also known as transport rules). But admins can use _quarantine
policies_ to define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages
based on why the message was quarantined (for supported features). For
more information, see link:quarantine-policies.md[Quarantine policies].

Admins in organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can also
manage files that were quarantined by
link:mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md[Safe Attachments for SharePoint&#44;
OneDrive&#44; and Microsoft Teams].

You view and manage quarantined messages in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal or in PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell for Microsoft 365
organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online; standalone EOP
PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

Watch this short video to learn how to manage quarantined messages as an
administrator. > [!VIDEO

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* To open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to
https://security.microsoft.com. To go directly to the *Quarantine* page,
use https://security.microsoft.com/quarantine.
* To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Connect
to Exchange Online PowerShell]. To connect to standalone EOP PowerShell,
see
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-protection-powershell[Connect
to Exchange Online Protection PowerShell].
* You need to be assigned permissions in *Exchange Online* before you
can do the procedures in this article:
** To take action on quarantined messages for all users, you need to be
a member of the *Organization Management*, *Security Administrator*, or
*Quarantine Administrator** role groups. To submit messages to
Microsoft, you need to be a member of the *Security Administrator* role
group.
** For read-only access to quarantined messages for all users, you need
to be a member of the *Global Reader* or *Security Reader* role groups.
+
For more information, see
link:/exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo[Permissions in Exchange
Online].
+
*Notes*:
** Adding users to the corresponding Azure Active Directory role in the
Microsoft 365 admin center gives users the required permissions _and_
permissions for other features in Microsoft 365. For more information,
see link:../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md[About admin roles].
** The *View-Only Organization Management* role group in
link:/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups[Exchange
Online] also gives read-only access to the feature.
** * Members of the *Quarantine Administrator* role group in *Email &
collaboration* roles in the
link:++permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md#email--collaboration-roles-in-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal++[Microsoft
365 Defender portal] also need to be members of the *Hygiene Management*
role group in
link:/Exchange/permissions-exo/permissions-exo#role-groups[Exchange
Online] to do quarantine procedures in Exchange Online PowerShell.
* Quarantined messages are retained for a default period of time based
on why they were quarantined. After the retention period expires, the
messages are automatically deleted and are not recoverable. For more
information, see link:quarantine-email-messages.md[Quarantined email
messages in EOP and Defender for Office 365].

=== Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage quarantined email messages

determine that the message was quarantined instead of delivered. Be sure
to include the full message ID value, which might include angle brackets
(<>). For example:

* *Time received*: Enter a *Start time* and *End time* (date).
* *Expires*: Filter messages by when they will expire from quarantine:
** *Today*
** *Next 2 days*
** *Next 7 days*
** *Custom*: Enter a *Start time* and *End time* (date).

in Defender for Office 365. The *Policy Type* value indicates which
feature was used.

protection quarantined the message
(link:set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#spoof-settings[spoof settings] or
link:set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365[impersonation
protection]).
** *High confidence phishing*
* *Recipient*: *All users* or *Only me*. End users can only manage
quarantined messages sent to them.
* *Release status*: Any of the following values:
** *Needs review*
** *Approved*
** *Denied*
** *Release requested*
** *Released*
* *Policy Type*: Filter messages by policy type:
** *Anti-malware policy*

When you’re finished, click *Apply*. To clear the filters, click
image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png[Clear filters icon.]
*Clear filters*.
. Use the *Search* box and a corresponding value to find specific
messages. Wildcards aren’t supported. You can search by the following
values:
* Sender email address
* Subject. Use the entire subject of the message. The search is not
case-sensitive.

to faith@contoso.com and john@subsidiary.contoso.com. Gmail bifurcates
this message into two copies that are both routed to quarantine as
phishing in Microsoft. An admin releases both of these messages to
admin@contoso.com. The first released message that reaches the admin
mailbox is delivered. The second released message is identified as
duplicate delivery and is skipped. Message are identified as duplicates
if they have the same message ID and received time.
