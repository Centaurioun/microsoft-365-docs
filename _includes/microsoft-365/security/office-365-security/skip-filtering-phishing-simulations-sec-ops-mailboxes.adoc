== Configure the delivery of third-party phishing simulations to users and unfiltered messages to SecOps mailboxes

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to* - link:eop-about.md[Exchange Online Protection] -
link:defender-for-office-365.md[Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1
and plan 2] - link:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender]

To keep your organization link:secure-by-default.md[secure by default],
Exchange Online Protection (EOP) does not allow safe lists or filtering
bypass for messages that are identified as malware or high confidence
phishing. But, there are specific scenarios that require the delivery of
unfiltered messages. For example:

* *Third-party phishing simulations*: Simulated attacks can help you
identify vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your
organization.
* *Security operations (SecOps) mailboxes*: Dedicated mailboxes that are
used by security teams to collect and analyze unfiltered messages (both
good and bad).

You use the _advanced delivery policy_ in Microsoft 365 to prevent
inbound messages _in these specific scenarios_ from being filtered*. The
advanced delivery policy ensures that messages in these scenarios
achieve the following results:

* Filters in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 take no action on
these messages.*
* link:zero-hour-auto-purge.md[Zero-hour Purge (ZAP)] for spam and
phishing take no action on these messages**.
* link:/microsoft-365/compliance/alert-policies#default-alert-policies[Default
system alerts] aren’t triggered for these scenarios.
* link:air-about.md[AIR and clustering in Defender for Office 365]
ignores these messages.
* Specifically for third-party phishing simulations:
** link:submissions-admin.md[Admin submissions] generates an automatic
response saying that the message is part of a phishing simulation
campaign and isn’t a real threat. Alerts and AIR will not be triggered.
The admin submissions experience will show these messages as a simulated
threat.
** When a user reports a phishing simulation message using the
link:submissions-outlook-report-messages.md#use-the-built-in-report-button-in-outlook-on-the-web[built-in
Report button in Outlook on the web] or the
link:submissions-outlook-report-messages.md#use-the-report-message-and-report-phishing-add-ins-in-outlook[Microsoft
Report Message or Report Phishing add-ins], the system will not generate
an alert, investigation, or incident. The links or files will not be
detonated, but the message will appear on the *User reported* tab of the
*Submissions* page.
** link:safe-links-about.md[Safe Links in Defender for Office 365]
doesn’t block or detonate the specifically identified URLs in these
messages at time of click. URLs are still wrapped, but they aren’t
blocked.
** link:safe-attachments-about.md[Safe Attachments in Defender for
Office 365] doesn’t detonate attachments in these messages.

* You can’t bypass malware filtering.

** You can bypass ZAP for malware by creating an anti-malware policy for
the SecOps mailbox where ZAP for malware is turned off. For
instructions, see link:anti-malware-policies-configure.md[Configure
anti-malware policies in EOP].

Messages that are identified by the advanced delivery policy aren’t
security threats, so the messages are marked with system overrides.
Admin experiences will show these messages as due to either a *Phishing
simulation* system override or a *SecOps mailbox* system override.
Admins can filter and analyze on these system overrides in the following
experiences:

* link:threat-explorer-about.md[Threat Explorer/Real-time detections in
Defender for Office 365 plan 2]: Admin can filter on *System override
source* and select either *Phishing simulation* or *SecOps Mailbox*.
* The link:mdo-email-entity-page.md[Email entity Page in Threat
Explorer/Real-time detections]: Admin can view a message that was
allowed by organization policy by either *SecOps mailbox* or *Phishing
simulation* under *Tenant override* in the *Override(s)* section.
* The
link:reports-email-security.md#threat-protection-status-report[Threat
protection status report]: Admin can filter by *view data by System
override* in the drop down menu and select to see messages allowed due
to a phishing simulation system override. To see messages allowed by the
SecOps mailbox override, you can select *chart breakdown by delivery
location* in the *chart breakdown by reason* drop down menu.
* link:../defender-endpoint/advanced-hunting-overview.md[Advanced
hunting in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint]: Phishing simulation and
SecOps mailbox system overrides will show as options within
OrgLevelPolicy in EmailEvents.
* link:campaigns.md[Campaign Views]: Admin can filter on *System
override source* and select either *Phishing simulation* or *SecOps
Mailbox*.

next to each value until there are no more domains, IPs, or URLs
selected.
. When you’re finished, click *Save* and then click *Close*.

=== Additional scenarios that require filtering bypass

In addition to the two scenarios that the advanced delivery policy can
help you with, there are other scenarios where you might need to bypass
filtering:

* *Third-party filters*: If your domain’s MX record _doesn’t_ point to
Office 365 (messages are routed somewhere else first),
link:secure-by-default.md[secure by default] _is not available_. If
you’d like to add protection, you’ll need to enable Enhanced Filtering
for Connectors (also known as _skip listing_). For more information, see
link:/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud[Manage
mail flow using a third-party cloud service with Exchange Online]. If
you don’t want Enhanced Filtering for Connectors, use mail flow rules
(also known as transport rules) to bypass Microsoft filtering for
messages that have already been evaluated by third-party filtering. For
more information, see
link:/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/use-rules-to-set-scl[Use
mail flow rules to set the SCL in messages].
* *False positives under review*: You might want to temporarily allow
certain messages that are still being analyzed by Microsoft via
link:submissions-admin.md[admin submissions] to report known good
messages that are incorrectly being marked as bad to Microsoft (false
positives). As with all overrides, we *_highly recommended_* that these
allowances are temporary.

=== PowerShell procedures for SecOps mailboxes in the advanced delivery policy

In PowerShell, the basic elements of SecOps mailboxes in the advanced
delivery policy are:

* *The SecOps override policy*: Controlled by the
**-SecOpsOverridePolicy* cmdlets.
* *The SecOps override rule*: Controlled by the **-SecOpsOverrideRule*
cmdlets.

This behavior has the following results:

* You create the policy first, then you create the rule that identifies
the policy that the rule applies to.
* When you remove a policy from PowerShell, the corresponding rule is
also removed.
* When you remove a rule from PowerShell, the corresponding policy is
not removed. You need to remove the corresponding policy manually.

==== Use PowerShell to configure SecOps mailboxes

Configuring a SecOps mailbox in the advanced delivery policy in
PowerShell is a two-step process:

[arabic]
. Create the SecOps override policy.
. Create the SecOps override rule that specifies the policy that the
rule applies to.

===== Step 1: Use PowerShell to create the SecOps override policy

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Name SecOpsOverridePolicy -SentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>
----

____
[!NOTE] Regardless of the Name value you specify, the policy name will
be _SecOpsOverridePolicy_, so you might as well use that value.
____

This example creates the SecOps mailbox policy.

[source,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Name SecOpsOverridePolicy -SentTo secops@contoso.com
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-secopsoverridepolicy[New-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

===== Step 2: Use PowerShell to create the SecOps override rule

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
New-SecOpsOverrideRule -Name SecOpsOverrideRule -Policy SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

____
[!NOTE] Regardless of the Name value you specify, the rule name will be
__SecOpsOverrideRule__<GUID> where <GUID> is a unique GUID value (for
example, 6fed4b63-3563-495d-a481-b24a311f8329).
____

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-secopsoverriderule[New-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to view the SecOps override policy

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about the
one and only SecOps mailbox policy.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-secopsoverridepolicy[Get-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to view SecOps override rules

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about
SecOps override rules.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverrideRule
----

Although the previous command should return only one rule, any rules
that are pending deletion might also be included in the results.

This example identifies the valid rule (one) and any invalid rules.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-SecOpsOverrideRule | Format-Table Name,Mode
----

After you identify the invalid rules, you can remove them by using the
*Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule* cmdlet as described
link:#use-powershell-to-remove-secops-override-rules[later in this
article].

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-secopsoverriderule[Get-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the SecOps override policy

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy [-AddSentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>] [-RemoveSentTo <EmailAddress1>,<EmailAddress2>,...<EmailAddressN>]
----

This example adds `secops2@contoso.com` to the SecOps override policy.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy -AddSentTo secops2@contoso.com
----

____
[!NOTE] If an associated, valid SecOps override rule exists, the email
addresses in the rule will also be updated.
____

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-secopsoverridepolicy[Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to modify a SecOps override rule

The *Set-SecOpsOverrideRule* cmdlet does not modify the email addresses
in the SecOps override rule. To modify the email addresses in the SecOps
override rule, use the *Set-SecOpsOverridePolicy* cmdlet.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-secopsoverriderule[Set-SecOpsOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to remove the SecOps override policy

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], this example removes the SecOps Mailbox policy and
the corresponding rule.

[source,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverridePolicy -Identity SecOpsOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/remove-secopsoverridepolicy[Remove-SecOpsOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to remove SecOps override rules

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule -Identity <RuleIdentity>
----

This example removes the specified SecOps override rule.

[source,powershell]
----
Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule -Identity SecOpsOverrideRule6fed4b63-3563-495d-a481-b24a311f8329
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/remove-secopsoverriderule[Remove-SecOpsOverrideRule].

=== PowerShell procedures for third-party phishing simulations in the advanced delivery policy

In PowerShell, the basic elements of third-party phishing simulations in
the advanced delivery policy are:

* *The phishing simulation override policy*: Controlled by the
**-PhishSimOverridePolicy* cmdlets.
* *The phishing simulation override rule*: Controlled by the
**-PhishSimOverrideRule* cmdlets.
* *The allowed (unblocked) phishing simulation URLs*: Controlled by the
**-TenantAllowBlockListItems* cmdlets.

This behavior has the following results:

* You create the policy first, then you create the rule that identifies
the policy that the rule applies to.
* You modify the settings in the policy and the rule separately.
* When you remove a policy from PowerShell, the corresponding rule is
also removed.
* When you remove a rule from PowerShell, the corresponding policy is
not removed. You need to remove the corresponding policy manually.

==== Use PowerShell to configure third-party phishing simulations

Configuring a third-party phishing simulation in PowerShell is a
multi-step process:

[arabic]
. Create the phishing simulation override policy.
. Create the phishing simulation override rule that specifies:
* The policy that the rule applies to.
* The source IP address of the phishing simulation messages.
. Optionally, identity the phishing simulation URLs that should be
allowed (that is, not blocked or scanned).

===== Step 1: Use PowerShell to create the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], this example creates the phishing simulation
override policy.

[source,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Name PhishSimOverridePolicy
----

*Note*: Regardless of the Name value you specify, the policy name will
be _PhishSimOverridePolicy_, so you might as well use that value.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-phishsimoverridepolicy[New-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

===== Step 2: Use PowerShell to create the phishing simulation override rule

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverrideRule -Name PhishSimOverrideRule -Policy PhishSimOverridePolicy -Domains <Domain1>,<Domain2>,...<Domain10> -SenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntry10>
----

Regardless of the Name value you specify, the rule name will be
__PhishSimOverrideRule__<GUID> where <GUID> is a unique GUID value (for
example, a0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011).

A valid IP address entry is one of the following values:

* Single IP: For example, 192.168.1.1.
* IP range: For example, 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.254.
* CIDR IP: For example, 192.168.0.1/25.

This example creates the phishing simulation override rule with the
specified settings.

[source,powershell]
----
New-PhishSimOverrideRule -Name PhishSimOverrideRule -Policy PhishSimOverridePolicy -Domains fabrikam.com,wingtiptoys.com -SenderIpRanges 192.168.1.55
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-phishsimoverriderule[New-PhishSimOverrideRule].

===== Step 3: (Optional) Use PowerShell to identify the phishing simulation URLs to allow

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -Allow -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery -Entries "<URL1>","<URL2>",..."<URL10>" <[-NoExpiration] | [-ExpirationDate <DateTime>]>
----

For details about the URL syntax, see
link:tenant-allow-block-list-urls-configure.md#url-syntax-for-the-tenant-allowblock-list[URL
syntax for the Tenant Allow/Block List]

This example adds a URL allow entry for the specified third-party
phishing simulation URL with no expiration.

[source,powershell]
----
New-TenantAllowBlockListItems -Allow -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery -Entries *.fabrikam.com -NoExpiration
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/new-tenantallowblocklistitems[New-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

==== Use PowerShell to view the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about
the one and only phishing simulation override policy.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverridePolicy
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-phishsimoverridepolicy[Get-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to view phishing simulation override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], this example returns detailed information about
phishing simulation override rules.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverrideRule
----

Although the previous command should return only one rule, any rules
that are pending deletion might also be included in the results.

This example identifies the valid rule (one) and any invalid rules.

[source,powershell]
----
Get-PhishSimOverrideRule | Format-Table Name,Mode
----

After you identify the invalid rules, you can remove them by using the
*Remove-PhishSimOverrideRule* cmdlet as described
link:#use-powershell-to-remove-phishing-simulation-override-rules[later
in this article].

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-phishsimoverriderule[Get-PhishSimOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to view the allowed phishing simulation URL entries

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], run the following command:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems -ListType Url -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/get-tenantallowblocklistitems[Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the phishing simulation override policy

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Identity PhishSimOverridePolicy [-Comment "<DescriptiveText>"] [-Enabled <$true | $false>]
----

This example disables the phishing simulation override policy.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy -Identity PhishSimOverridePolicy -Enabled $false
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-phishsimoverridepolicy[Set-PhishSimOverridePolicy].

==== Use PowerShell to modify phishing simulation override rules

In link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell[Security &
Compliance PowerShell], use the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverrideRule -Identity PhishSimOverrideRulea0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011 [-Comment "<DescriptiveText>"] [-AddSenderDomainIs <DomainEntry1>,<DomainEntry2>,...<DomainEntryN>] [-RemoveSenderDomainIs <DomainEntry1>,<DomainEntry2>,...<DomainEntryN>] [-AddSenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntryN>] [-RemoveSenderIpRanges <IPAddressEntry1>,<IPAddressEntry2>,...<IPAddressEntryN>]
----

This example modifies the specified phishing simulation override rule
with the following settings:

* Add the domain entry blueyonderairlines.com.
* Remove the IP address entry 192.168.1.55.

Note that these changes don’t affect existing entries.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-PhishSimOverrideRule -Identity PhishSimOverrideRulea0eae53e-d755-4a42-9320-b9c6b55c5011 -AddSenderDomainIs blueyonderairlines.com -RemoveSenderIpRanges 192.168.1.55
----

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see
link:/powershell/module/exchange/set-phishsimoverriderule[Set-PhishSimOverrideRule].

==== Use PowerShell to modify the allowed phishing simulation URL entries

You can’t modify the URL values directly. You can
link:#use-powershell-to-remove-the-allowed-phishing-simulation-url-entries[remove
existing URL entries] and
link:#step-3-optional-use-powershell-to-identify-the-phishing-simulation-urls-to-allow[add
new URL entries] as described in this article.

In
link:/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell[Exchange
Online PowerShell], to modify other properties of an allowed phishing
simulation URL entry (for example, the expiration date or comments), use
the following syntax:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-TenantAllowBlockListItems <-Entries "<URL1>","<URL2>",..."<URLN>" | -Ids <Identity>> -ListType URL -ListSubType AdvancedDelivery <[-NoExpiration] | [-ExpirationDate <DateTime>]> [-Notes <String>]
----

You identify the entry to modify by its URL values (the _Entries_
parameter) or the Identity value from the output of the
*Get-TenantAllowBlockListItems* cmdlet (the _Ids_ parameter).

This example modified the expiration date of the specified entry.
