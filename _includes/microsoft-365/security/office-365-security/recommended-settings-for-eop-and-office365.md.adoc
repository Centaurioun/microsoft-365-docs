== Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/mdo-trial-banner.adoc[MDO Trial banner]]

*Applies to*

* xref:exchange-online-protection-overview.adoc[Exchange Online Protection]

* xref:../defender/microsoft-365-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender]

*Exchange Online Protection (EOP)* is the core of security for Microsoft 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes.
But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are often required.
*Microsoft Defender for Office 365* Plan 1 or Plan 2 contain additional features that give admins more layers of security, control, and investigation.

Although we empower security administrators to customize their security settings, there are two security levels in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that we recommend: *Standard* and *Strict*.
Although customer environments and needs are different, these levels of filtering will help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees' Inbox in most situations.

To automatically apply the Standard or Strict settings to users, see xref:preset-security-policies.adoc[Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365].

This article describes the default settings, and also the recommended Standard and Strict settings to help protect your users.
The tables contain the settings in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and PowerShell (Exchange Online PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell for organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes).

____
[!NOTE] The Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA) module for PowerShell can help you (admins) find the current values of these settings.
Specifically, the *Get-ORCAReport* cmdlet generates an assessment of anti-spam, anti-phishing, and other message hygiene settings.
You can download the ORCA module at https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/.

In Microsoft 365 organizations, we recommend that you leave the Junk Email Filter in Outlook set to *No automatic filtering* to prevent unnecessary conflicts (both positive and negative) with the spam filtering verdicts from EOP.
For more information, see the following articles:

=== Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection in EOP

Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing are EOP features that can be configured by admins.
We recommend the following Standard or Strict configurations.

==== EOP anti-spam policy settings

To create and configure anti-spam policies, see xref:configure-your-spam-filter-policies.adoc[Configure anti-spam policies in EOP].

| *Actions*
|
|
|
| Wherever you select *Quarantine message*, a *Select quarantine policy* box is available.
Quarantine policies define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages.
+  + Standard and Strict preset security policies use the default quarantine policies (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy or DefaultFullAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications) as described in the table link:quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features[here].
+  + When you create a new anti-spam policy, a blank value means the default quarantine policy is used to define the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined by that particular verdict (AdminOnlyAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications for *High confidence phishing*;
DefaultFullAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications for everything else).
+  + Admins can create and select custom quarantine policies that define more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities for users in the default or custom anti-spam policies.
For more information, see xref:quarantine-policies.adoc[Quarantine policies].

| *Spam* detection action +  + _SpamAction_
| *Move message to Junk Email folder* +  + `MoveToJmf`

| *Move message to Junk Email folder*^*^ +  + `MoveToJmf`
| *Quarantine message* +  + `Quarantine`
| *Quarantine message* +  + `Quarantine`
| ^*^ The default value is *Move message to Junk Email folder* in the default anti-spam policy and in new anti-spam policies that you create in PowerShell.
The default value is *Quarantine message* in new anti-spam policies that you create in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

| *High confidence phishing* detection action +  + _HighConfidencePhishAction_

=== Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security

Additional security benefits come with a Microsoft Defender for Office 365 subscription.
For the latest news and information, you can see xref:whats-new-in-defender-for-office-365.adoc[What's new in Defender for Office 365].

____
[!IMPORTANT]

* The default anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides link:set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#spoof-settings[spoof protection] and mailbox intelligence for all recipients.
However, the other available <<impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365,impersonation protection>> features and <<advanced-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365,advanced settings>> are not configured or enabled in the default policy.
To enable all protection features, modify the default anti-phishing policy or create additional anti-phishing policies.
* Although there's no default Safe Attachments policy or Safe Links policy, the *Built-in protection* preset security policy provides Safe Attachments protection and Safe Links protection to all recipients (users who aren't defined in the Standard or Strict preset security policies or in custom Safe Attachments policies or Safe Links policies).
For more information, see xref:preset-security-policies.adoc[Preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365].
* xref:mdo-for-spo-odb-and-teams.adoc[Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams] protection and xref:safe-docs.adoc[Safe Documents] protection have no dependencies on Safe Links policies.
____

If your subscription includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or if you've purchased Defender for Office 365 as an add-on, set the following Standard or Strict configurations.

==== Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

EOP customers get basic anti-phishing as previously described, but Defender for Office 365 includes more features and control to help prevent, detect, and remediate against attacks.
To create and configure these policies, see xref:configure-mdo-anti-phishing-policies.adoc[Configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365].

| Wherever you select *Quarantine the message*, a *Select quarantine policy* box is available.
Quarantine policies define what users are allowed to do to quarantined messages.
+  + Standard and Strict preset security policies use the default quarantine policy (DefaultFullAccessPolicy with no quarantine notifications) as described in the table link:quarantine-policies.md#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features[here].
+  + When you create a new anti-phishing policy, a blank value means the default quarantine policy is used to define the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined by that verdict (DefaultFullAccessPolicy for all impersonation detection types).
+  + Admins can create and select custom quarantine policies that define less restrictive or more restrictive capabilities for users in the default or custom anti-phishing policies.
For more information, see xref:quarantine-policies.adoc[Quarantine policies].
