=== Step 1: Begin onboarding Security Teams

If your organization has a security response team, now is the time to
begin integrating Microsoft Defender for Office 365 into your response
processes, including ticketing systems. This is an entire topic unto
itself, but it’s sometimes overlooked. Getting the security response
team involved early will ensure that your organization is ready to deal
with threats when you switch your MX records. Incident response needs to
be well equipped to handle the following tasks:

* Learn the new tools and integrate them into existing flows. For
example:
** Admin management of quarantined messages is important. For
instructions, see link:quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md[Manage
quarantined messages and files as an admin].
** Message trace allows you to see what happened to messages as they
enter or leave Microsoft 365. For more information, see
link:/exchange/monitoring/trace-an-email-message/message-trace-modern-eac[Message
trace in the modern Exchange admin center in Exchange Online].
* Identify risks that may have been let into the organization.
* Tune and customize link:../../compliance/alert-policies.md[alerts] for
organizational processes.
* Manage the incident queue and remediate potential risks.

If your organization has purchased Microsoft Defender for Office 365
Plan 2, they should begin familiarizing themselves with and using
features such as Threat Explorer, Advanced Hunting, and Incidents. For
relevant trainings, see https://aka.ms/mdoninja.

If your security response team collects and analyzes unfiltered
messages, you can configure a SecOps mailbox to receive these unfiltered
messages. For instructions, see
link:skip-filtering-phishing-simulations-sec-ops-mailboxes.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-configure-secops-mailboxes-in-the-advanced-delivery-policy[Configure
SecOps mailboxes in the advanced delivery policy].

==== SIEM/SOAR

For more information about integrating with your SIEM/SOAR, see the
following articles:

* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-overview[Overview of
Microsoft 365 Defender APIs]
* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/streaming-api[Streaming API]
* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-advanced-hunting[Advanced
Hunting API]
* link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-incident[Incidents APIs]

If your organization does not have a security response team or existing
process flows, you can use this time to familiarize yourself with basic
hunting and response features in Defender for Office 365. For more
information, see link:office-365-ti.md[Threat investigation and
response].

==== RBAC roles

Permissions in Defender for Office 365 is based on role-based access
control (RBAC) and is explained in Permissions in the
link:mdo-portal-permissions.md[Microsoft 365 Defender portal]. These are
the important points to keep in mind:

* Azure AD roles give permissions to *all* workloads in Microsoft 365.
For example, if you add a user to the Security Administrator in the
Azure portal, they have Security Administrator permissions everywhere.
* Email & collaboration roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal give
permissions to the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal and the Microsoft
Purview compliance portal. For example, if you add a user to Security
Administrator in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, they have Security
Administrator access *only* in the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal and the
Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
* Many features in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal are based on
Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets and therefore require role group
membership in the corresponding roles (technically, role groups) in
Exchange Online (in particular, for access to the corresponding Exchange
Online PowerShell cmdlets).
* There are Email & collaboration roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal that have no equivalent to Azure AD roles, and are important for
security operations (for example the Preview role and the Search and
Purge role).

Typically, only a subset of security personnel will need additional
rights to download messages directly from user mailboxes. This requires
an additional permission that Security Reader does not have by default.

=== Step 2: (Optional) Exempt pilot users from filtering by your existing protection service

Although this step isn’t required, you should consider configuring your
pilot users to bypass filtering by your existing protection service.
This action allows Defender for Office 365 to handle *all* filtering and
protection duties for the pilot users. If you don’t exempt your pilot
users from your existing protection service, Defender for Office 365
effectively operates only on misses from the other service (filtering
messages that have already been filtered).

____
[!NOTE] This step is explicitly required if your current protection
service provides link wrapping, but you want to pilot Safe Links
functionality. Double wrapping of links is not supported.
____

=== Step 3: Tune spoof intelligence

Check the link:anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md[Spoof intelligence
insight] to see what’s being allowed or blocked as spoofing, and to
determine if you need to override the system verdict for spoofing. Some
sources of your business-critical email might have incorrectly
configured email authentication records in DNS (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC)
and you might be using overrides in your existing protection service to
mask their domain issues.

Spoof intelligence can rescue email from domains without proper email
authentication records in DNS, but the feature sometimes needs
assistance in distinguishing good spoofing from bad spoofing. Focus on
the following types of message sources:

* Message sources that are outside of the IP address ranges defined in
link:/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors[Enhanced
Filtering for Connectors].
* Message sources that have the highest number of messages.
* Message sources that have the highest impact on your organization.

Spoof intelligence will eventually tune itself after you configure user
reported message settings, so there is no need for perfection.

=== Step 4: Tune impersonation protection and mailbox intelligence

After you’ve had enough time to observe the results of impersonation
protection in *Don’t apply any action* mode, you can individually turn
on each impersonation protection action in the anti-phishing policies:

* User impersonation protection: *Quarantine the message* for both
Standard and Strict.
* Domain impersonation protection: *Quarantine the message* for both
Standard and Strict.
* Mailbox intelligence protection: *Move message to the recipients’ Junk
Email folders* for Standard; *Quarantine the message* for Strict.

The longer you monitor the impersonation protection results without
acting on the messages, the more data you’ll have to identify allows or
blocks that might be required. Consider using a delay between turning on
each protection that’s significant enough to allow for observation and
adjustment.

____
[!NOTE] Frequent and continuous monitoring and tuning of these
protections is important. If you suspect a false positive, investigate
the cause and use overrides only as necessary and only for the detection
feature that requires it.
____

==== Tune mailbox intelligence

Although mailbox intelligence has been configured to take no action on
messages that were
link:anti-phishing-mdo-impersonation-insight.md[determined to be
impersonation attempts], it has been on and learning the email sending
and receiving patterns of the pilot users. If an external user is in
contact with one your pilot users, messages from that external user
won’t be identified as impersonation attempts by mailbox intelligence
(thus reducing false positives).

When you’re ready, do the following steps to allow mailbox intelligence
to act on messages that are detected as impersonation attempts:

* In the anti-phishing policy with the Standard protection settings,
change the value of *If mailbox intelligence detects an impersonated
user* to *Move message to recipients’ Junk Email folders*.
* In the anti-phishing policy with the Strict protection settings,
change the value of *If mailbox intelligence detects and impersonated
user* from to *Quarantine the message*.

To modify the policies, see
link:anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md[Configure anti-phishing
policies in Defender for Office 365].

After you’ve observed the results and made any adjustments, proceed to
the next section to quarantine messages detected by user impersonation.

==== Tune user impersonation protection

In both of your anti-phishing policies based on Standard and Strict
settings, change the value of *If message is detected as an impersonated
user* to *Quarantine the message*.

Check the link:anti-phishing-mdo-impersonation-insight.md[impersonation
insight] to see what’s being blocked as user impersonation attempts.

To modify the policies, see
link:anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md[Configure anti-phishing
policies in Defender for Office 365].

After you’ve observed the results and made any adjustments, proceed to
the next section to quarantine messages detected by domain
impersonation.

==== Tune domain impersonation protection

In both of your anti-phishing policies based on Standard and Strict
settings, change the value of *If message is detected as an impersonated
domain* to *Quarantine the message*.

Check the link:anti-phishing-mdo-impersonation-insight.md[impersonation
insight] to see what’s being blocked as domain impersonation attempts.

To modify the policies, see
link:anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure.md[Configure anti-phishing
policies in Defender for Office 365].

Observe the results and make any adjustments as necessary.

=== Step 5: Use data from user reported messages to measure and adjust

As your pilot users report false positives and false negatives, the
messages will appear on the *User reported* tab of the
link:submissions-admin.md[Submissions page in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal]. You can report the misidentified messages to Microsoft for
analysis and use the information to adjust the settings and exceptions
in your pilot polices as necessary.

Use the following features to monitor and iterate on the protection
settings in Defender for Office 365:

* link:quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files.md[Quarantine]
* link:email-security-in-microsoft-defender.md[Threat Explorer]
* link:reports-email-security.md[Email security reports]
* link:reports-defender-for-office-365.md[Defender for Office 365
reports]
* link:/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-insights/mail-flow-insights[Mail
flow insights]
* link:/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mail-flow-reports[Mail
flow reports]

If your organization uses a third-party service for user reported
messages, you can integrate that data into your feedback loop.

=== Step 6: (Optional) Add more users to your pilot and iterate

As you find and fix issues, you can add more users to the pilot groups
(and correspondingly exempt those new pilot users from scanning by your
existing protection service as appropriate). The more testing that you
do now, the fewer user issues that you’ll need to deal with later. This
``waterfall'' approach allows tuning against larger portions of the
organization and gives your security teams time to adjust to the new
tools and processes.

* Microsoft 365 generates alerts when high confidence phishing messages
are allowed by organizational policies. To identify these messages, you
have the following options:
** Overrides in the
link:reports-email-security.md#threat-protection-status-report[Threat
protection status report].
** Filter in Threat Explorer to identify the messages.
** Filter in Advanced Hunting to identify the messages.
+
Report any false positives to Microsoft as early as possible through
admin submissions, use the link:tenant-allow-block-list-about.md[Tenant
Allow/Block List] feature to configure safe overrides for those false
positives.
* It’s also a good idea to examine unnecessary overrides. In other
words, look at the verdicts that Microsoft 365 would have provided on
the messages. If Microsoft365 rendered the correct verdict, then the
need for override is greatly diminished or eliminated.

=== Step 7: Extend Microsoft 365 protection to all users and turn off the SCL=-1 mail flow rule

Do the steps in this section when you’re ready to switch your MX records
to point to Microsoft 365.

[arabic]
. Extend the pilot policies to the entire organization. Fundamentally,
there are different ways to do this:
* Use link:preset-security-policies.md[preset security] policies and
divide your users between the Standard protection profile and the Strict
protection profile (make sure everyone is covered). Preset security
policies are applied before any custom polices that you’ve created or
any default policies. You can turn off your individual pilot policies
without deleting them.
+
The drawback to preset security policies is you can’t change many of the
important settings after you’ve created them.
* Change the scope of the policies that you created and adjusted during
the pilot to include all users (for example, all recipients in all
domains). Remember, if multiple policies of the same type (for example,
anti-phishing policies) apply to the same user (individually, by group
membership, or email domain), only the settings of the policy with the
highest priority (lowest priority number) are applied, and processing
stops for that type of policy.
. Turn off the SCL=-1 mail flow rule (you can turn it off without
deleting it).
. Verify that the previous changes have taken effect, and that Defender
for Office 365 is now properly enabled for all users. At this point, all
of the protection features of Defender for Office 365 are now allowed to
act on mail for all recipients, but that mail has already been scanned
by your existing protection service.

You can pause at this stage for more large-scale data recording and
tuning.

=== Step 8: Switch your MX records

____
{empty}[!NOTE]

* When you switch the MX record for your domain, it can take up to 48
hours for the changes to propagate throughout the internet.
* We recommend lowering the TTL value of your DNS records to enable
faster response and possible rollback (if required). You can revert to
the original TTL value after the switchover is complete and verified.
* You should consider starting with changing domains that are used less
frequently. You can pause and monitor before moving to larger domains.
However, even if you do this, you still should make sure that all users
and domains are covered by policies, because secondary SMTP domains are
resolved to primary domains prior to the policy application.
* Multiple MX records for a single domain will technically work,
allowing you to have split routing, provided that you have followed all
the guidance in this article. Specifically, you should make sure that
policies are applied to all users, that the SCL=-1 mail flow rule is
applied only to mail that passes through your existing protection
service as described in
link:migrate-to-defender-for-office-365-setup.md#step-3-maintain-or-create-the-scl-1-mail-flow-rule[Setup
Step 3: Maintain or create the SCL=-1 mail flow rule]. However, this
configuration introduces behavior that makes troubleshooting much more
difficult, and therefore we do not typically recommend it, especially
for extended periods of time.
* Before you switch your MX records, verify that the following settings
are not enabled on the inbound connector from the protection service to
Microsoft 365. Typically, the connector will have one or more of the
following settings configured:
** *and require that the subject name on the certificate that the
partner uses to authenticate with Office 365 matches this domain name*
(_RestrictDomainsToCertificate_)
** *Reject email messages if they aren’t sent from within this IP
address range* (_RestrictDomainsToIPAddresses_) If the connector type is
*Partner* and either of these settings are turned on, all mail delivery
to your domains will fail after you switch your MX records. You need to
disable these settings before you continue. If the connector is an
on-premises connector that’s used for hybrid, you don’t need to modify
the on-premises connector. But, you can still check for the presence of
a *Partner* connector.
* If your current mail gateway is also providing recipient validation,
you may want to check that the domain is configured as
link:/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains[Authoritative]
in Microsoft 365. This can prevent unnecessary bounce messages.
____

When you’re ready, switch the MX record for your domains. You can
migrate all of your domains at once. Or, you can migrate less frequently
used domains first, and then migrate the rest later.

Feel free to pause and evaluate here at any point. But, remember: once
you turn off the SCL=-1 mail flow rule, users might have two different
experiences for checking false positives. The sooner you can provide a
single, consistent experience, the happier your users and help desk
teams will be when they have to troubleshoot a missing message.

=== Next steps

Congratulations! You have completed your
link:migrate-to-defender-for-office-365.md#the-migration-process[migration
to Microsoft Defender for Office 365]! Because you followed the steps in
this migration guide, the first few days where mail is delivered
directly into Microsoft 365 should be much smoother.

Now you begin the normal operation and maintenance of Defender for
Office 365. Monitor and watch for issues that are similar to what you
experienced during the pilot, but on a larger scale. The
link:anti-spoofing-spoof-intelligence.md[spoof intelligence insight] and
the link:anti-phishing-mdo-impersonation-insight.md[impersonation
insight] will be most helpful, but consider making the following
activities a regular occurrence:

* Review user reported messages, especially
link:air-about-office.md[user-reported phishing messages]
* Review overrides in the
link:reports-email-security.md#threat-protection-status-report[Threat
protection status report].
* Use
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-example[Advanced
Hunting] queries to look for tuning opportunities and risky messages.
