As automated investigations on email & collaboration content result in verdicts, such as _Malicious_ or _Suspicious_, certain remediation actions are created.
In Microsoft Defender for Office 365, remediation actions can include:

* Soft deleting email messages or clusters
* Turning off external mail forwarding

These remediation actions are not taken unless and until your security operations team approves them.
We recommend reviewing and approving any pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations complete in a timely manner.
In some cases, you can reconsider submitted actions.
You need to be part of Search & purge role before taking any actions.
