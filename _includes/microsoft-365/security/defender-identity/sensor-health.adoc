=== Add a sensor

From the *Sensors* page, you can add a new sensor.

[arabic]
. Select *Add sensor*.
+
:::image type=``content''
source=``../../media/defender-identity/add-sensor.png'' alt-text=``The
Add sensor option''
lightbox=``../../media/defender-identity/add-sensor.png'':::
. A pane will open, providing you with a button to download the sensor
installer and a generated access key.

:::image type=``content''
source=``../../media/defender-identity/installer-access-key.png''
alt-text=``The options to download the installer and regenerate the
key''
lightbox=``../../media/defender-identity/installer-access-key.png'':::
. Select *Download installer* to save the package locally. The zip file
includes the following files:
* The Defender for Identity sensor installer
* The configuration setting file with the required information to
connect to the Defender for Identity cloud service
. Copy the *Access key*. The access key is required for the Defender for
Identity sensor to connect to your Defender for Identity instance. The
access key is a one-time-password for sensor deployment, after which all
communication is performed using certificates for authentication and TLS
encryption. Use the *Regenerate key* button if you ever need to
regenerate the new access key. It won’t affect any previously deployed
sensors, because it’s only used for initial registration of the sensor.
. Copy the package to the dedicated server or domain controller onto
which you’re installing the Defender for Identity sensor.
