This article provides information about new features and important
product updates for the latest release of Microsoft Defender
Vulnerability Management public preview.

=== December 2022

Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for
iOS is now Generally Available. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports
vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For
more details, see
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/ios-configure-features#configure-vulnerability-assessment-of-apps[Configure
vulnerability assessment of apps].

=== October 2022

Several Linux platforms have high numbers of CVEs that are reported in
official channels as not having a fix available (Red Hat, CentOS,
Debian, and Ubuntu). This results in a high volume of non-actionable
CVEs appearing in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

To address this, Defender Vulnerability Management will no longer report
such CVEs on the above Linux platforms. The new behavior may lead to
reporting of fewer exposed devices and lower organization exposure
score.

=== September 2022

* Vulnerability assessment of apps on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
for iOS is now in public preview. Defender for Endpoint on iOS supports
vulnerability assessments of apps only for enrolled (MDM) devices. For
more information, see
