A browser extension is a small software application that adds
functionality to a web browser. Visibility into the browser extensions
installed can help you ensure the safe usage of extensions in your
organization.

The *Browser extensions* page displays a list of the browser extensions
installed across different browsers in your organization. For each
installed extension, you can see the devices it’s installed on and if
it’s turned on or off on these devices. The information available will
not only help you learn about the installed extensions, but it can help
you make decisions on how you would like to manage the extensions.

=== View your browser extensions

[arabic]
. Go to *Vulnerability management* > *Software inventory* in the
https://security.microsoft.com[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
. Select the *Browser extensions* tab.

The *Browser extensions* page opens with a list of the browser
extensions installed across your organization, including details on the
extension name, browser, the number of devices the extension is
installed on, and the number that have it turned on.

for a particular browser.

The *Requested permissions* and *Permissions risk* columns provide more
specific information on the number of permissions requested by the
extension, and the permissions risk level based on the type of access to
devices or sites it requested.

Where applicable, there will be a link available on this page to access
the extension in the store it was installed from.

==== Browser extension permissions

Browser extensions usually need different types of permission to run
properly, for example, they may require permission to modify a webpage.

Select the *Permissions* tab, from the browser extension flyout pane, to
see information on the permissions the browser extension needs to run,
and whether this permission is optional or not.

The permission risk level generated is based on the type of access the
permission is requesting. You can use this information to help make an
informed decision on whether you want to allow or block this extension.

[!Note] Risk is subjective, and it’s up to each organization to
determine the types of risk they are willing to take on.
