Your exposure score is visible in the
link:tvm-dashboard-insights.md[Defender Vulnerability Management
dashboard] of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. It reflects how
vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. Low exposure
score means your devices are less vulnerable from exploitation.

* Quickly understand and identify high-level takeaways about the state
of security in your organization.
* Detect and respond to areas that require investigation or action to
improve the current state.
* Communicate with peers and management about the impact of security
efforts.

The card gives you a high-level view of your exposure score trend over
time. Any spikes in the chart give you a visual indication of a high
cybersecurity threat exposure that you can investigate further.

* 70-100: high exposure score

You can remediate the issues based on prioritized

the exposure score. Each software has weaknesses that are transformed
into recommendations and prioritized based on risk to the organization.
