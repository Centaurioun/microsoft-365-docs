The ability to share files and folders over a network allows users to
provide access to resources like files, documents, and media to other
people on the network. As network shares can be easily accessed by
network users, some common weaknesses exist that can cause network
shares to be vulnerable.

When vulnerable network share configurations are identified, they’re
mapped to actionable security recommendations in the Security
recommendations page. The following recommendations can help protect
against vulnerabilities in network shares that could be exploited by
attackers:

* Disallow offline access to shares
* Remove shares from the root folder
* Remove share write permission set to `Everyone'
* Set folder enumeration for shares

=== Find information about exposed network shares

To see security recommendations addressing network share configurations:

[arabic]
. Go to *Vulnerability management* > *Recommendations*.

lightbox=``../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/network-share-filter.png'':::

[arabic, start=3]
. Select *Apply*.

If there are network shares with vulnerabilities to address, they’ll
appear in the list of recommendations
