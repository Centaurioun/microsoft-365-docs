Firmware and hardware attacks are on the rise. Attackers are
increasingly targeting firmware and device drivers of hardware
components to gain high privilege and persistence. Visibility into the
threat posture of your firmware and hardware, and timely remediation of
identified vulnerabilities is a vital part of keeping your organization
secure.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management hardware and firmware
assessment provides a list of known hardware and firmware in your
organization. It provides individual inventories for system models,
processors, and BIOS. Each view includes details such as the name of the
vendor, number of weaknesses, threats insights, and the number of
exposed devices.

=== View your hardware and firmware

To access the hardware and firmware assessment page:

[arabic]
. Go to *Vulnerability management* > *Inventories* in the
https://security.microsoft.com[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
. Select the *Hardware and Firmware* tab.

The *Hardware and Firmware* page opens with individual pages available
for:

* link:#laptop-desktop-and-server-modals-inventory[Laptop&#44; desktop&#44; and
server modals inventory]
* link:#processor-inventory[Processor inventory]
* link:#bios-inventory[BIOS inventory]

____
[!Note] Weaknesses and exposed devices information is based on security
advisories from HP, Dell, and Lenovo and relates to processors and BIOS
only. Weaknesses for other vendors are not reported.

Inventory and weaknesses data is collected on Windows, Linux, and MacOS
(refer to the link:tvm-supported-os.md[list of supported platforms]).

*Note*: processor and BIOS information is not reported on Mac devices
with M1 and M2 processors.
