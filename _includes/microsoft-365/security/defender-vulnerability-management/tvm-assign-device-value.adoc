Defining a deviceâ€™s value helps you differentiate between asset
priorities. The device value is used to incorporate the risk appetite of
an individual asset into the Defender Vulnerability Management exposure
score calculation. Devices assigned as ``high value'' will receive more
weight.

You can also use the link:../defender-endpoint/set-device-value.md[set
device value API].

Device value options:

* Low
* Normal (Default)
* High

Examples of devices that should be assigned a high value:

* Domain controllers, Active Directory
* Internet facing devices
* VIP devices
* Devices hosting internal/external production services

=== How device value impacts your exposure score

The exposure score is a weighted average across all devices. If you have
device groups, you can also filter the score by device group.

* Normal devices have a weight of 1
* Low value devices have a weight of 0.75
* High value devices have a weight of NumberOfAssets / 10.
** If you have 100 devices, each high value device will have a weight of
10 (100/10)
