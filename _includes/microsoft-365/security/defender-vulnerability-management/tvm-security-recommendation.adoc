Cybersecurity weaknesses identified in your organization are mapped to
actionable security recommendations and prioritized by their impact.
Prioritized recommendations help shorten the time to mitigate or
remediate vulnerabilities and drive compliance.

Each security recommendation includes actionable remediation steps. To
help with task management, the recommendation can also be sent using
Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. When the
threat landscape changes, the recommendation also changes as it
continuously collects information from your environment.

=== How it works

Each device in the organization is scored based on three important
factors to help customers to focus on the right things at the right
time.

* *Threat*: Characteristics of the vulnerabilities and exploits in your
organizations’ devices and breach history. Based on these factors, the
security recommendations show the corresponding links to active alerts,
ongoing threat campaigns, and their corresponding threat analytic
reports.
* *Breach likelihood*: Your organization’s security posture and
resilience against threats.
* *Business value*: Your organization’s assets, critical processes, and
intellectual properties.

=== Navigate to the Security recommendations page

Access the Security recommendations page a few different ways:

* Vulnerability management navigation menu in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal
* Top security recommendations in the
link:tvm-dashboard-insights.md[vulnerability management dashboard]

==== Navigation menu

Go to the *Vulnerability management* navigation menu and select
*Recommendations*. The page contains a list of security recommendations
for the threats and vulnerabilities found in your organization.

==== Top security recommendations in the vulnerability management dashboard

In a given day as a Security Administrator, you can take a look at the
link:tvm-dashboard-insights.md[vulnerability management dashboard] to
see your link:tvm-exposure-score.md[exposure score] side by side with
your link:tvm-microsoft-secure-score-devices.md[Microsoft Secure Score
for Devices]. The goal is to *lower* your organization’s exposure from
vulnerabilities, and *increase* your organization’s device security to
be more resilient against cybersecurity threat attacks. The top security
recommendations list can help you achieve that goal.

:::image type=``content'' alt-text=``Screenshot of the vulnerability
management dashboard with security recommendations highlighted.''
source=``../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/top-security-recommendations.png''
lightbox=``../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/top-security-recommendations.png'':::

The top security recommendations list the improvement opportunities
prioritized based on the important factors mentioned in the previous
section - threat, likelihood to be breached, and value. Selecting a
recommendation will take you to the security recommendations page with
more details.

=== Security recommendations overview

View recommendations, the number of weaknesses found, related
components, threat insights, number of exposed devices, status,
remediation type, remediation activities, impact to your exposure score
and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices, and associated tags.

The color of the *Exposed devices* graph changes as the trend changes.
If the number of exposed devices is on the rise, the color changes to
red. If there’s a decrease in the number of exposed devices, the color
of the graph will change to green.

____
[!NOTE] Vulnerability management shows devices that were in use up to
*30 days* ago. This is different from the rest of Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint, where if a device has not been in use for more than 7 days it
has in an `Inactive' status.

==== Icons

Useful icons also quickly call your attention to:

* image:../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm_alert_icon.png[arrow
hitting a target.] possible active alerts
* image:../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm_bug_icon.png[red
bug.] associated public exploits
* image:../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm_insight_icon.png[light
bulb.] recommendation insights

==== Explore security recommendation options

Select the security recommendation that you want to investigate or
process.

:::image type=``content'' alt-text=``Example of a security
recommendation flyout page.''
source=``../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/secrec-flyouteolsw.png''
lightbox=``../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/secrec-flyouteolsw.png'':::

From the flyout, you can choose any of the following options:

* *Open software page* - Open the software page to get more context on
the software and how it’s distributed. The information can include
threat context, associated recommendations, weaknesses discovered,
number of exposed devices, discovered vulnerabilities, names and
detailed of devices with the software installed, and version
distribution.
* link:tvm-remediation.md[*Remediation options*] - Submit a remediation
request to open a ticket in Microsoft Intune for your IT administrator
to pick up and address. Track the remediation activity in the
Remediation page.
* link:tvm-exception.md[*Exception options*] - Submit an exception,
provide justification, and set exception duration if you can’t remediate
the issue yet.

____
[!NOTE] When a software change is made on a device, it typically takes 2
hours for the data to be reflected in the security portal. However, it
may sometimes take longer. Configuration changes can take anywhere from
4 to 24 hours.
____

==== Investigate changes in device exposure or impact

If there is a large jump in the number of exposed devices, or a sharp
increase in the impact on your organization exposure score and Microsoft
Secure Score for Devices, then that security recommendation is worth
investigating.

[arabic]
. Select the recommendation and *Open software page*
. Select the *Event timeline* tab to view all the impactful events
related to that software, such as new vulnerabilities or new public
exploits. link:threat-and-vuln-mgt-event-timeline.md[Learn more about
event timeline]
. Decide how to address the increase or your organization’s exposure,
such as submitting a remediation request

==== Recommendations on devices

To see the list of security recommendations that apply to a device you
can:

[arabic]
. Select the device from the *Exposed devices* tab in the recommendation
flyout panel or select the device directly from the *Device inventory*
page.
. Select the *Security recommendations* tab to see a list of security
recommendations for this device.

____

=== Request remediation

The vulnerability management remediation capability bridges the gap
between Security and IT administrators through the remediation request
workflow. Security admins like you can request for the IT Administrator
to remediate a vulnerability from the *Security recommendation* page to
Intune. link:tvm-remediation.md[Learn more about remediation options]

==== How to request remediation

Select a security recommendation you would like to request remediation
for, and then select *Remediation options*. Fill out the form and select
*Submit request*. Go to the link:tvm-remediation.md[*Remediation*] page
to view the status of your remediation request.
link:tvm-remediation.md#request-remediation[Learn more about how to
request remediation]

=== File for exception

As an alternative to a remediation request when a recommendation is not
relevant at the moment, you can create exceptions for recommendations.
link:tvm-exception.md[Learn more about exceptions]

Only users with ``exceptions handling'' permissions can add exception.
link:../defender-endpoint/user-roles.md[Learn more about RBAC roles].

When an exception is created for a recommendation, the recommendation is
no longer active. The recommendation state will change to *Full
exception* or *Partial exception* (by device group).

==== How to create an exception

Select a security recommendation you would like to create an exception
for, and then select *Exception options*.

image::../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exception-options.png[Showing
where the button for ``exception options'' is location in a security
recommendation flyout.]

Fill out the form and submit. To view all your exceptions (current and
past), navigate to the link:tvm-remediation.md[Remediation] page under
the *Threat & Vulnerability Management* menu and select the *Exceptions*
tab. link:tvm-exception.md#create-an-exception[Learn more about how to
create an exception]

=== Report inaccuracy

You can report a false positive when you see any vague, inaccurate,
incomplete, or already remediated security recommendation information.

[arabic]
. Open the Security recommendation.
. Select the three dots beside the security recommendation that you want
to report, then select *Report inaccuracy*.
. From the flyout pane, select the inaccuracy category from the
drop-down menu, fill in your email address, and details regarding the
inaccuracy.
