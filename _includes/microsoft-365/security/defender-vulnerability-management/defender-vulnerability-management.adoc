With Defender Vulnerability Management, you can empower your security
and IT teams to bridge workflow gaps and prioritize and address critical
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization. Reduce
cyber security risk with:

=== Asset discovery & inventory

Defender Vulnerability Management built-in and agentless scanners
continuously monitor and detect risk in your organization even when
devices aren’t connected to the corporate network.

A single inventory with a real-time consolidated view of your
organization’s software applications, digital certificates, network
shares, and browser extensions helps you discover and assess all your
organization’s assets.

View information on extension permissions and associated risk levels,
identify certificates before they expire, detect potential
vulnerabilities due to weak signature algorithms, and assess
misconfigurations in internal network shares.

=== Vulnerability & configuration assessment

Understand and assess your cyber exposure with advanced vulnerability
and configuration assessment tools.

* *Security baselines assessment* - Create customizable baseline
profiles to measure risk compliance against established benchmarks, such
as, Center for Internet Security (CIS) and Security Technical
Implementation Guides (STIG).
* *Visibility into software and vulnerabilities* - Get a view of the
organization’s software inventory, and software changes like
installations, uninstalls, and patches.
* *Network share assessment* - See actionable security recommendations,
in the security recommendations page, for network share configurations
identified as vulnerable.
* *Threat analytics & event timelines* - Use event timelines, and
entity-level vulnerability assessments to understand and prioritize
vulnerabilities.
* *Browser extensions* - View a list of the browser extensions installed
across different browsers in your organization.
* *Digital certificates* - View a list of certificates installed across
your organization in a single central certificate inventory page.

=== Risk-based intelligent prioritization

Defender Vulnerability Management leverage Microsoft’s threat
intelligence, breach likelihood predictions, business contexts, and
device assessments to quickly prioritize the biggest vulnerabilities in
your organization. A single view of prioritized recommendations from
multiple security feeds, along with critical details including related
CVEs and exposed devices, helps you quickly remediate the biggest
vulnerabilities on your most critical assets. Risk-based intelligent
prioritization:

* *Focuses on emerging threats* - Dynamically aligns the prioritization
of security recommendations with vulnerabilities currently being
exploited in the wild and emerging threats that pose the highest risk.
* *Pinpoints active breaches* - Correlates vulnerability management and
EDR insights to prioritize vulnerabilities being exploited in an active
breach within the organization.
* *Protects high-value assets* - Identifies exposed devices with
business-critical applications, confidential data, or high-value users.

=== Remediation and tracking

Enable security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate and
seamlessly remediate issues with built-in workflows.

* *Remediation requests sent to IT* - Create a remediation task in
Microsoft Intune from a specific security recommendation.
* *Block vulnerable applications* - Mitigate risk with the ability to
block vulnerable applications for specific device groups.
* *Alternate mitigations* - Gain insights on other mitigations, such as
configuration changes that can reduce risk associated with software
vulnerabilities.
* *Real-time remediation status* - Real-time monitoring of the status
and progress of remediation activities across the organization.
