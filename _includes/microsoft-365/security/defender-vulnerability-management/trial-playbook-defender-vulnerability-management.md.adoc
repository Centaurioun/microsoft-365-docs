== Trial playbook: Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

=== Welcome to the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management trial playbook

This playbook is a simple guide to help you make the most of your free trial.
Using the suggested steps in this playbook from the Microsoft Security team, you'll learn how vulnerability management can help you protect all your users and data.

=== What is Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management?

Reducing cyber risk requires a comprehensive risk-based vulnerability management program to identify, assess, remediate, and track important vulnerabilities across your most critical assets.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is a new service that proactively provides continuous real-time discovery and assessment of vulnerabilities, context-aware threat & business prioritization, and built-in remediation processes.
It includes all Defender Vulnerability Management capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and new enhanced capabilities so your teams can further intelligently assess, prioritize, and seamlessly remediate the biggest risks to your organization.

Details on your purchase options for this new offering will be made available once the offering is generally available.
____

____
[!NOTE] Once you activate the trial it can take up to 6 hours for the new features to become available in the portal.
____

Now that you have set up your trial, it's time to try key capabilities.

==== Step 2: Know what to protect in a single view

Built-in and agentless scanners continuously monitor and detect risk even when devices aren't connected to the corporate network.
Expanded asset coverage consolidates software applications, digital certificates, network shares, and browser extensions into a single inventory view.

. xref:../defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview.adoc[*Device inventory*] - The device inventory shows a list of the devices in your network.
By default, the list displays devices seen in the last 30 days.
At a glance, you'll see information such as domains, risk levels, OS platform, associated CVEs, and other details for easy identification of devices most at risk.
. Discover and assess your organization's software in a single, consolidated inventory view:
 ** xref:tvm-software-inventory.adoc[*Software application inventory*] - the software inventory in Defender Vulnerability Management is a list of known applications in your organization.
The view includes vulnerability and misconfiguration insights across installed software with prioritized impact scores and details such as OS platforms, vendors, number of weaknesses, threats, and an entity-level view of exposed devices.
 ** xref:tvm-browser-extensions.adoc[*Browser extension assessments*] - the browser extensions page displays a list of the extensions installed across different browsers in your organization.
Extensions usually need different permissions to run properly.
Defender Vulnerability Management provides detailed information on the permissions requested by each extension and identifies those with the highest associated risk levels, the devices with the extension turned on, installed versions, and more.
 ** xref:tvm-certificate-inventory.adoc[*Certificate inventory*] - the certificate inventory allows you to discover, assess, and manage digital certificates installed across your organization in a single view.
This can help you:
  *** Identify certificates that are about to expire so you can update them and prevent service disruption.
  *** Detect potential vulnerabilities due to the use of weak signature algorithm (for example, SHA-1-RSA), short key size (for example, RSA 512 bit), or weak signature hash algorithm (for example, MD5).
  *** Ensure compliance with regulatory guidelines and organizational policy.
. xref:tvm-assign-device-value.adoc[Assign device value] - defining a device's value helps you differentiate between asset priorities.
The device value is used to incorporate the risk appetite of an individual asset into the Defender Vulnerability Management exposure score calculation.
Devices assigned as "high value" will receive more weight.
Device value options:
 ** Low
 ** Normal (Default)
 ** High

==== Step 3: Track and mitigate remediation activities

. link:tvm-remediation.md#request-remediation[*Request remediation*] - vulnerability management capabilities bridge the gap between Security and IT administrators through the remediation request workflow.
Security admins like you can request for the IT Administrator to remediate a vulnerability from the *Recommendation* pages to link:/mem/intune/[Intune].
. link:tvm-remediation.md#view-your-remediation-activities[*View your remediation activities*] - when you submit a remediation request from the Security recommendations page, it kicks-off a remediation activity.
A security task is created that can be tracked on a *Remediation* page, and a remediation ticket is created in Microsoft Intune.
. xref:tvm-block-vuln-apps.adoc[*Block vulnerable applications*] - Remediating vulnerabilities takes time and can be dependent on the responsibilities and resources of the IT team.
Security admins can temporarily reduce the risk of a vulnerability by taking immediate action to block all currently known vulnerable versions of an application or warn users with customizable messages before opening vulnerable app versions until the remediation request is completed.
The block option gives IT teams time to patch the application without security admins worrying that the vulnerabilities will be exploited in the meantime.
 ** link:tvm-block-vuln-apps.md#how-to-block-vulnerable-applications[How to block vulnerable applications]
 ** link:tvm-block-vuln-apps.md#view-remediation-activities[View remediation activities]
 ** link:tvm-block-vuln-apps.md#view-blocked-applications[View blocked applications]
 ** link:tvm-block-vuln-apps.md#unblock-applications[Unblock applications]
. Use enhanced assessment capabilities such as xref:tvm-network-share-assessment.adoc[Network shares analysis] to protect vulnerable network shares.
As network shares can be easily accessed by network users, small common weaknesses can make them vulnerable.
These types of misconfigurations are commonly used in the wild by attackers for lateral movement, reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and more.
That's why we built a new category of configuration assessments in Defender Vulnerability Management that identify the common weaknesses that expose your endpoints to attack vectors in Windows network shares.
This helps you:
 ** Disallow offline access to shares
 ** Remove shares from the root folder
 ** Remove share write permission set to 'Everyone'
 ** Set folder enumeration for shares
. View and monitor your organization's devices using a xref:tvm-vulnerable-devices-report.adoc[*Vulnerable devices report*] that shows graphs and bar charts with vulnerable device trends and current statistics.
The goal is for you to understand the breath and scope of your device exposure.

==== Step 4: Set up security baseline assessments

Instead of running point-in-time compliance scans, security baselines assessment helps you to continuously and proactively monitor your organization's compliance against industry security benchmarks in real time.
A security baseline profile is a customized profile that you can create to assess and monitor endpoints in your organization against industry security benchmarks (CIS, NIST, MS).
When you create a security baseline profile, you're creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration settings and a base benchmark to compare against.

Security baselines provide support for Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks for Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and above, as well as Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) benchmarks for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

. Review link:tvm-security-baselines.md#review-security-baseline-profile-assessment-results[security baseline profile assessment results]
. link:tvm-security-baselines.md#use-advanced-hunting[Use advanced hunting]

==== Step 5: Create meaningful reports to get in-depth insights using APIs and Advanced Hunting

Defender Vulnerability Management APIs can help drive clarity in your organization with customized views into your security posture and automation of vulnerability management workflows.
Alleviate your security team's workload with data collection, risk score analysis, and integrations with your other organizational processes and solutions.
