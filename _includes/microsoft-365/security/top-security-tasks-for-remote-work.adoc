Before you begin, check your
link:./defender/microsoft-secure-score.md[Microsoft 365 Secure Score] in
the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. From a centralized dashboard, you can
monitor and improve the security for your Microsoft 365 identities,
data, apps, devices, and infrastructure. You are given points for
configuring recommended security features, performing security-related
tasks (such as viewing reports), or addressing recommendations with a
third-party application or software. The recommended tasks in this
article will raise your score.

:::image type=``content'' source=``../media/secure-score.png''
alt-text=``The Microsoft Secure Score screen in the Microsoft 365
Defender portal'' lightbox=``../media/secure-score.png'':::

=== 1: Enable Azure AD Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

The single best thing you can do to improve security for employees
working from home is to turn on MFA. If you don’t already have processes
in place, treat this as an emergency pilot and make sure you have
support folks ready to help employees who get stuck. As you probably
can’t distribute hardware security devices, use Windows Hello biometrics
and smartphone authentication apps like Microsoft Authenticator.

Normally, Microsoft recommends you give users 14 days to register their
device for Multifactor Authentication before requiring MFA. However, if
your workforce is suddenly working from home, go ahead and require MFA
as a security priority and be prepared to help users who need it.

Applying these policies will take only a few minutes, but be prepared to
support your users over the next several days.

=== 2: Protect against threats

All Microsoft 365 plans include a variety of threat protection features.
Bumping up protection for these features takes just a few minutes.

* Anti-malware protection
* Protection from malicious URLs and files
* Anti-phishing protection
* Anti-spam protection

See link:office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md[Protect against
threats in Office 365] for guidance you can use as a starting point.

=== 3: Configure Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Microsoft Defender for Office 365, included with Microsoft 365 E5 and
Office 365 E5, safeguards your organization against malicious threats
posed by email messages, links (URLs) and collaboration tools. This can
take several hours to configure.

Microsoft Defender for Office 365:

* Protects your organization from unknown email threats in real time by
using intelligent systems that inspect attachments and links for
malicious content. These automated systems include a robust detonation
platform, heuristics, and machine learning models.
* Protects your organization when users collaborate and share files, by
identifying and blocking malicious files in team sites and document
libraries.
* Applies machine learning models and advanced impersonation-detection
algorithms to avert phishing attacks.

For an overview, including a summary of plans, see
link:./office-365-security/defender-for-office-365.md[Defender for
Office 365].

Your Global Administrator can configure these protections:

* link:office-365-security/safe-links-policies-configure.md[Set up Safe
Links policies]
* link:office-365-security/safe-links-policies-global-settings-configure.md[Configure
global settings for Safe Links]
* link:office-365-security/safe-attachments-policies-configure.md[Set up
Safe Attachments policies]

You’ll need to work with your Exchange Online administrator and
SharePoint Online administrator to configure Defender for Office 365 for
these workloads:

* link:office-365-security/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about.md[Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint for SharePoint&#44; OneDrive&#44; and Microsoft Teams]

=== 4: Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity

link:/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp[Microsoft Defender
for Identity] is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your
on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and
investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious
insider actions directed at your organization. Focus on this next
because it protects your on-prem and your cloud infrastructure, has no
dependencies or prerequisites, and can provide immediate benefit.

* See link:/azure-advanced-threat-protection/install-atp-step1[Microsoft
Defender for Identity Quickstarts] to get setup quickly
* Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=EGY2m8yU_KE[Video:
Introduction to Microsoft Defender for Identity]
* Review the
link:/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp#whats-next[three
phases of Microsoft Defender for Identity deployment]

=== 5: Turn on Microsoft 365 Defender

Now that you have Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft
Defender for Identity configured, you can view the combined signals from
these capabilities in one dashboard.
link:./defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender] brings
together alerts, incidents, automated investigation and response, and
advanced hunting across workloads (Microsoft Defender for Identity,
Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft
Defender for Cloud Apps) into a single pane in the Microsoft 365
Defender portal.

lightbox=``../media/top-ten-security-remote-work-mtp-dashboard.png'':::

After you have configured one or more of your Defender for Office 365
services, turn on MTP. New features are added continually to MTP;
consider opting in to receive preview features.

* link:./defender/microsoft-365-defender.md[Learn more about MTP]
* link:./defender/m365d-enable.md[Turn on MTP]
* link:./defender/preview.md[Opt in for preview features]

=== 6: Configure Intune mobile app protection for phones and tablets

Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM) allows you to
manage and protect your organization’s data on phones and tablets
without managing these devices. Here’s how it works:

* You create an App Protection Policy (APP) that determines which apps
on a device are managed and what behaviors are allowed (such as
preventing data from a managed app from being copied to an unmanaged
app). You create one policy for each platform (iOS, Android).
* After creating the app protection policies, you enforce these by
creating a conditional access rule in Azure AD to require approved apps
and APP data protection.

APP protection policies include many settings. Fortunately, you don’t
need to learn about every setting and weigh the options. Microsoft makes
it easy to apply a configuration of settings by recommending starting
points. The link:/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework[Data
protection framework using app protection policies] includes three
levels you can choose from.

Even better, Microsoft coordinates this app protection framework with a
set of conditional access and related policies we recommend all
organizations use as a starting point. If you’ve implemented MFA using
the guidance in this article, you’re half way there!

To configure mobile app protection, use the guidance in
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md[Common identity
and device access policies]:

[arabic]
. Use the
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md#app-protection-policies[Apply
APP data protection policies] guidance to create policies for iOS and
Android. Level 2 (enhanced data protection) is recommended for baseline
protection.
. Create a conditional access rule to
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md#require-approved-apps-and-app-protection-policies[Require
approved apps and APP protection].

=== 7: Configure MFA and conditional access for guests, including Intune mobile app protection

Next, let’s ensure you can continue to collaborate and work with guests.
If you’re using the Microsoft 365 E3 plan and you implemented MFA for
all users, you’re set.

If you’re using the Microsoft 365 E5 plan and you’re taking advantage of
Azure Identity Protection for risk-based MFA, you need to make a couple
of adjustments (because Azure AD Identity protection doesn’t extend to
guests):

* Create a new conditional access rule to require MFA always for guests
and external users.
* Update the risk-based MFA conditional access rule to exclude guests
and external users.

Use the guidance in
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies-guest-access.md[Updating
the common policies to allow and protect guest and external access] to
understand how guest access works with Azure AD and to update the
affected policies.

The Intune mobile app protection policies you created, together with the
conditional access rule to require approved apps and APP protection,
apply to guests accounts and will help protect your organization data.

____
[!NOTE] If you’ve already enrolled PCs into device management to require
compliant PCs, you’ll also need to exclude guest accounts from the
conditional access rule that enforces device compliance.
____

=== 8: Enroll PCs into device management and require compliant PCs

There are several methods to enroll your workforce’s devices. Each
method depends on the device’s ownership (personal or corporate), device
type (iOS, Windows, Android), and management requirements (resets,
affinity, locking). This can take a bit of time to sort out. See:
link:/mem/intune/enrollment/[Enroll devices in Microsoft Intune].

The quickest way to get going is to
link:/mem/intune/enrollment/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment[Set up
automatic enrollment for Windows 10 devices].

You can also take advantage of these tutorials:

* link:/mem/intune/enrollment/tutorial-use-autopilot-enroll-devices[Use
Autopilot to enroll Windows devices in Intune]
* link:/mem/intune/enrollment/tutorial-use-device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios[Use
Apple’s Corporate Device Enrollment features in Apple Business Manager
(ABM) to enroll iOS/iPadOS devices in Intune]

After enrolling devices, use the guidance in
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md[Common identity
and device access policies] to create these policies:

* link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md#create-device-compliance-policies[Define
device-compliance policies] — The recommended settings for Windows 10
include requiring antivirus protection. If you have Microsoft 365 E5,
use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to monitor the health of employee
devices. Be sure compliance policies for other operating systems include
antivirus protection and end-point protection software.
* link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md#require-compliant-pcs-and-mobile-devices[Require
compliant PCs] — This is the conditional access rule in Azure AD that
enforces the device compliance policies.

Only one organization can manage a device, so be sure to exclude guest
accounts from the conditional access rule in Azure AD. If you don’t
exclude guest and external users from policies that require device
compliance, these policies will block these users. For more information,
see
link:./office-365-security/identity-access-policies-guest-access.md[Updating
the common policies to allow and protect guest and external access].

=== 9: Optimize your network for cloud connectivity

If you are rapidly enabling the bulk of your employees to work from
home, this sudden switch of connectivity patterns can have a significant
impact on the corporate network infrastructure. Many networks were
scaled and designed before cloud services were adopted. In many cases,
networks are tolerant of remote workers, but were not designed to be
used remotely by all users simultaneously.

Network elements such as VPN concentrators, central network egress
equipment (such as proxies and data loss prevention devices), central
internet bandwidth, backhaul MPLS circuits, NAT capability and so on are
suddenly put under enormous strain due to the load of the entire
business using them. The end result is poor performance and productivity
coupled with a poor user experience for users who are adapting to
working from home.

Some of the protections that have traditionally been provided by routing
traffic back through a corporate network are provided by the cloud apps
your users are accessing. If you’ve reached this step in this article,
you’ve implemented a set of sophisticated cloud security controls for
Microsoft 365 services and data. With these controls in place, you may
be ready to route remote users’ traffic directly to Office 365. If you
still require a VPN link for access to other applications, you can
greatly improve your performance and user experience by implementing
split tunneling. Once you achieve agreement in your organization, this
can be accomplished within a day by a well-coordinated network team.

See these resources on Docs for more information:

* link:/Office365/Enterprise/office-365-vpn-split-tunnel[Overview:
Optimize connectivity for remote users using VPN split tunneling]
* link:/Office365/Enterprise/office-365-vpn-implement-split-tunnel[Implementing
VPN split tunneling for Office 365]

controls in today’s unique remote work scenarios]

=== 10: Train users

Training users can save your users and security operations team a lot of
time and frustration. Savvy users are less likely to open attachments or
click links in questionable email messages, and they are more likely to
avoid suspicious websites.

The Harvard Kennedy School
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2015598&clcid=0x409[Cybersecurity
Campaign Handbook] provides excellent guidance on establishing a strong
culture of security awareness within your organization, including
training users to identify phishing attacks.

Microsoft 365 provides the following resources to help inform users in
your organization:
