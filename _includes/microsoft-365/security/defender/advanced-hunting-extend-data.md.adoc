=== Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor on the domain controller

If you're running Active Directory on premises, you need to install the Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor on the domain controller to get data for Microsoft Defender for Identity.
When installed and properly configured, this data also feeds into advanced hunting through Microsoft Defender for Identity and provides a more holistic picture of identity information and events in your network.
This data also enhances the ability of Microsoft Defender for Identity to generate relevant alerts that are also covered by advanced hunting.

|===
| Data | Description | Schema table | How to configure

| Domain controller
| Data from on-premises Active Directory sent to Microsoft Defender for Identity, enriching identity-related information, such as account details, logon activity, and Active Directory queries
| Multiple tables, including xref:advanced-hunting-identityinfo-table.adoc[IdentityInfo], xref:advanced-hunting-identitylogonevents-table.adoc[IdentityLogonEvents], and xref:advanced-hunting-identityqueryevents-table.adoc[IdentityQueryEvents]
