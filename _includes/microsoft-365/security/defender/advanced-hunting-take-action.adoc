*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/prerelease.md[Prerelease information]]

You can quickly contain threats or address compromised assets that you
find in link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting] using
powerful and comprehensive action options. With these options, you can:

* Take various actions on devices
* Quarantine files

=== Required permissions

To take action on devices through advanced hunting, you need a role in
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/user-roles#permission-options[permissions
to submit remediation actions on devices]. If you canâ€™t take action,
contact a global administrator about getting the following permission:

_Active remediation actions > Threat and vulnerability management -
Remediation handling_

To take action on emails through advanced hunting, you need a role in
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to
link:/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/scc-permissions[search
and purge emails].

=== Take various actions on devices

You can take the following actions on devices identified by the
`DeviceId` column in your query results:

* Isolate affected devices to contain an infection or prevent attacks
from moving laterally
* Collect investigation package to obtain more forensic information
* Run an antivirus scan to find and remove threats using the latest
security intelligence updates
* Initiate an automated investigation to check and remediate threats on
the device and possibly other affected devices
* Restrict app execution to only Microsoft-signed executable files,
preventing subsequent threat activity through malware or other untrusted
executables

To learn more about how these response actions are performed through
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint,
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts[read
about response actions on devices].

==== Quarantine files

You can deploy the _quarantine_ action on files so that they are
automatically quarantined when encountered. When selecting this action,
you can choose between the following columns to identify which files in
your query results to quarantine:

* `SHA1`: In most advanced hunting tables, this column refers to the
SHA-1 of the file that was affected by the recorded action. For example,
if a file was copied, this affected file would be the copied file.
* `InitiatingProcessSHA1`: In most advanced hunting tables, this column
refers to the file responsible for initiating the recorded action. For
example, if a child process was launched, this initiator file would be
part of the parent process.
* `SHA256`: This column is the SHA-256 equivalent of the file identified
by the `SHA1` column.
* `InitiatingProcessSHA256`: This column is the SHA-256 equivalent of
the file identified by the `InitiatingProcessSHA1` column.

be restored,

____
[!NOTE] To locate files and quarantine them, the query results should
also include `DeviceId` values as device identifiers.

To take any of the described actions, select one or more records in your
query results and then select *Take actions*. A wizard will guide you
through the process of selecting and then submitting your preferred
actions.

=== Take various actions on emails

Apart from device-focused remediation steps, you can also take some
actions on emails from your query results. Select the records you want
to take action on, select *Take actions*, then under *Choose actions*,
select your choice from the following: - `Move to mailbox folder` -
select this to move the email messages to Junk, Inbox, or Deleted items
folder

portal''

* `Delete email` - select this to move email messages to the Deleted
items folder (*Soft delete*) or delete them permanently (*Hard delete*)

You can also provide a remediation name and a short description of the
action taken to easily track it in the action center history. You can
also use the Approval ID to filter for these actions in the action
center. This ID is provided at the end of the wizard:

:::image type=``content''

actions wizard showing choose actions for entities''
lightbox=``../../media/choose-email-actions-entities.png'':::

These email actions are applicable to
link:custom-detections-overview.md[custom detections] as well.

=== Review actions taken

Each action is individually recorded in the
link:m365d-action-center.md[action center] under *Action center* >
*History*
(https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history[security.microsoft.com/action-center/history]).
Go to the action center to check the status of each action.
