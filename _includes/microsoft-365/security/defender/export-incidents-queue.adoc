== Export incidents queue to CSV files

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

The *Export* feature allows you to export the data in the incident queue
that is displayed according to the applied filters and time ranges. Itâ€™s
available in the form of a button named *Export*, as displayed in the
following screenshot:

alt-text=``Shows the Export button in the Incidents page of the
Microsoft 365 Defender portal'':::

When you click the *Export* button, the data is exported to a CSV file.
You can apply various filters and time ranges to the incidents queue
(not just in the context of exporting the data, but in a generic
context). When you select *Export*, whichever filters and/or time ranges
are applied to the incidents queue, such data is exported to the CSV
file.

Once you export the incidents queue-related data onto the CSV file, you
can analyze the data and filter it further, based on your requirements.

For example, for the data on the CSV file, you can apply filters to view
the following data: - Data regarding how many high-severity incidents
you had in the last 30 days. - Data regarding who is your most
productive analyst.

____
[!NOTE] The maximum number of records you can export to a CSV file is
10,000.

If you have thoughts or suggestions about the new *Export* feature (the
*Export* button) for the incident queue, contact Microsoft team or send
your feedback through the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
