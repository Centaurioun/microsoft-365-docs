Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, xref:advanced-hunting-schema-tables.adoc[see the advanced hunting reference].

|===
| Column name | Data type | Description

| `Timestamp`
| `datetime`
| Date and time when the event was recorded

| `DeviceId`
| `string`
| Unique identifier for the machine in the service

| `DeviceName`

This group is used by role-based access control to determine access to the machine

| `ReportId`
| `long`
| Event identifier based on a repeating counter.
To identify unique events, this column must be used in conjunction with the DeviceName and Timestamp columns

| `OnboardingStatus`
| `string`
| Indicates whether the device is currently onboarded or not to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or if the device is not supported

| `AdditionalFields`
| `string`
| Additional information about the event in JSON array format

| `DeviceCategory`
| `string`
| Broader classification that groups certain device types under the following categories: Endpoint, Network device, IoT, Unknown

| `DeviceType`
| `string`
| Type of device based on purpose and functionality, such as network device, workstation, server, mobile, gaming console, or printer

| `DeviceSubType`
| `string`
| Additional modifier for certain types of devices, for example, a mobile device can be a tablet or a smartphone;
only available if device discovery finds enough information about this attribute

| `Model`
| `string`
| Model name or number of the product from the vendor or manufacturer, only available if device discovery finds enough information about this attribute

| `Vendor`
| `string`
| Name of the product vendor or manufacturer, only available if device discovery finds enough information about this attribute

|===

The `DeviceInfo` table provides device information based on heartbeats, which are periodic reports or signals from a device.
Every fifteen minutes, the device sends a partial heartbeat that contains frequently changing attributes like `LoggedOnUsers`.
Once a day, a full heartbeat containing the device's attributes is sent.

You can use the following sample query to get the latest state of a device:

[,kusto]
----
// Get latest information on user/device
DeviceInfo
| where DeviceName == "example" and isnotempty(OSPlatform)
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
----
