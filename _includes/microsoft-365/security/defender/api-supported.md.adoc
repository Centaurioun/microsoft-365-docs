For better performance, use a server closer to your geolocation:

* The United States: api-us.security.microsoft.com
* Europe: api-eu.security.microsoft.com

Tokens can be acquired by accessing https://api.security.microsoft.com.

All APIs along the `/api` path use the link:/odata/overview[OData] Protocol;
for example, https://api.security.microsoft.com/api/incidents.
