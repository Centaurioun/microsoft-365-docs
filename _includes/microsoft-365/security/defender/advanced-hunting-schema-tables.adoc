== Understand the advanced hunting schema

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/prerelease.md[Prerelease information]]

The link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting] schema is made
up of multiple tables that provide either event information or
information about devices, alerts, identities, and other entity types.
To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to
understand the tables and the columns in the advanced hunting schema.

=== Get schema information

While constructing queries, use the built-in schema reference to quickly
get the following information about each table in the schema:

* *Tables description*—type of data contained in the table and the
source of that data.
* *Columns*—all the columns in the table.
* *Action types*—possible values in the `ActionType` column representing
the event types supported by the table. This information is provided
only for tables that contain event information.
* *Sample query*—example queries that feature how the table can be
utilized.

==== Access the schema reference

To quickly access the schema reference, select the *View reference*
action next to the table name in the schema representation. You can also
select *Schema reference* to search for a table.

=== Learn the schema tables

The following reference lists all the tables in the schema. Each table
name links to a page describing the column names for that table. Table
and column names are also listed in the Defender for Cloud as part of
the schema representation on the advanced hunting screen.
