== Address false positives or false negatives in Microsoft 365 Defender

False positives or negatives can occasionally occur with any threat protection solution.
If xref:m365d-autoir.adoc[automated investigation and response capabilities] in Microsoft 365 Defender missed or wrongly detected something, there are steps your security operations team can take:

* <<report-a-false-positivenegative-to-microsoft-for-analysis,Report a false positive/negative to Microsoft>>
* <<adjust-an-alert-to-prevent-false-positives-from-recurring,Adjust your alerts>> (if needed)
