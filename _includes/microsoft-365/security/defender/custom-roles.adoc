== Custom roles in role-based access control for Microsoft 365 Defender

____
[!NOTE] If you are running the Microsoft 365 Defender preview program
you can now experience the new Microsoft Defender 365 role-based access
control (RBAC) model. For more information, see
link:manage-rbac.md[Microsoft Defender 365 role-based access control
(RBAC)].
____

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/prerelease.md[Prerelease]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

There are two types of roles that can be used to access to Microsoft 365
Defender:

* *Global Azure Active Directory (AD) roles*
* *Custom roles*

Access to Microsoft 365 Defender can be managed collectively by using
link:m365d-permissions.md[Global roles in Azure Active Directory (AAD)]

If you need greater flexibility and control over access to specific
product data, Microsoft 365 Defender access can also be managed with the
creation of Custom roles through each respective security portal.

For example, a Custom role created through Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint would allow access to the relevant product data, including
Endpoint data within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. Similarly, a
Custom role created through Microsoft Defender for Office 365 would
allow access to the relevant product data, including Email &
collaboration data within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

Users with existing Custom roles may access data in the Microsoft 365
Defender portal according to their existing workload permissions with no
additional configuration required.

=== Create and manage custom roles

Custom roles and permissions can be created and individually managed
through each of the following security portals:

* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint –
link:../defender-endpoint/user-roles.md[Edit roles in Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint]
* Microsoft Defender for Office 365 –
link:../office-365-security/scc-permissions.md?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide[Permissions
in the Security & Compliance Center]
* Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps –
link:/cloud-app-security/manage-admins[Manage admin access]

Each custom role created through an individual portal allows access to
the data of the relevant product portal. For example, a custom role
created through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will only allow access
to Defender for Endpoint data.

____
{empty}[!TIP] Permissions and roles can also be accessed through the
Microsoft 365 Defender portal by selecting Permissions & roles from the
navigation pane. Access to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is managed
through the Defender for Cloud Apps portal and controls access to
Microsoft Defender for Identity as well. See
link:/cloud-app-security/manage-admins[Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Apps]
____

____
[!NOTE] Custom roles created in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps have
access to Microsoft Defender for Identity data as well. Users with User
group admin, or App/instance admin Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
roles are not able to access Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps data
through the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
____

=== Manage permissions and roles in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Permissions and roles can also be managed in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal:

[arabic]
. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at
security.microsoft.com.
. In the navigation pane, select *Permissions & roles*.
. Under the *Permissions* header, select *Roles*.

____
[!NOTE] This only applies to Defender for Office 365 and Defender for
Endpoint. Access for other workloads must be done in their relevant
portals.
____

=== Required roles and permissions

The following table outlines the roles and permissions required to
access each unified experience in each workload. Roles defined in the
table below refer to custom roles in individual portals and are not
connected to global roles in Azure AD, even if similarly named.

____
[!NOTE] Incident management requires management permissions for all
products that are part of the incident.
