*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessmentKB` table in the advanced
hunting schema contains information about the various secure
configurations checked by
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt[Microsoft
Defender Vulnerability Management]. It also includes risk information,
related industry benchmarks, and applicable MITRE ATT&CK techniques and
tactics.

This table doesnâ€™t return events or records. We recommend joining this
table to the
link:advanced-hunting-devicetvmsecureconfigurationassessment-table.md[DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment]
table using `ConfigurationId` to view text information about the
security configurations in the returned assessments.

For example, when you query the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment`
table you might want to view the `ConfigurationDescription` for the
security configurations that come up in the assessment results. You can
see this information by joining this table to
`DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` using `ConfigurationId` and
project `ConfigurationDescription`.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see
link:advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md[the advanced hunting reference].

along with information on devices with non-compliant antivirus
configurations from the `DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment` table:
