remediation actions that are taken automatically or await your approval.

result in remediation actions, such as blocking a file, URL, or process,
or sending an artifact to quarantine.
* Your security operations team can take remediation actions manually,
such as during link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting] or
while investigating link:investigate-alerts.md[alerts] or
link:investigate-incidents.md[incidents].
