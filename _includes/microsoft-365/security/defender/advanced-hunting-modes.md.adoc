== Choose between guided and advanced modes to hunt in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/microsoft-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender

You can find the *advanced hunting* page by going to the left navigation bar in Microsoft 365 Defender and selecting *Hunting* > *Advanced hunting*.
If the navigation bar is collapsed, select the hunting icon image:../../media/guided-hunting/hunting-icon.png[hunting icon].

In the *advanced hunting* page, two modes are supported:

* *Guided mode* -- to query using the query builder
* *Advanced mode* -- to query using the query editor using Kusto Query Language (KQL)

The main difference between the two modes is that the guided mode _does not_ require the hunter to know KQL to query the database, while advanced mode requires KQL knowledge.

Guided mode features a query builder that has an easy-to-use, visual, building-block style of constructing queries through dropdown menus containing available filters and conditions.
To use guided mode, see link:advanced-hunting-modes.md#get-started-with-guided-hunting-mode[Get started with guided hunting mode].

Advanced mode features a query editor area where users can create queries from scratch.
To use advanced mode, see link:advanced-hunting-modes.md#get-started-with-advanced-hunting-mode[Get started with advanced hunting mode].
