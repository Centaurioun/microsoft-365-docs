=== Syntax

[source,kusto]
----
invoke FileProfile(x,y)
----

=== Arguments

* *x*—file ID column to use: `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `InitiatingProcessSHA1`,
or `InitiatingProcessSHA256`; function uses `SHA1` if unspecified
* *y*—limit to the number of records to enrich, 1-1000; function uses
100 if unspecified

____
[!TIP] Enrichment functions will show supplemental information only when
they are available. Availability of information is varied and depends on
a lot of factors. Make sure to consider this when using FileProfile() in
your queries or in creating custom detections. For best results, we
recommend using the FileProfile() function with SHA1.
____

=== Examples

==== Project only the SHA1 column and enrich it

[source,kusto]
----
DeviceFileEvents
| where isnotempty(SHA1) and Timestamp > ago(1d)
| take 10
| project SHA1
| invoke FileProfile()
----

==== Enrich the first 500 records and list low-prevalence files

[source,kusto]
----
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCreated" and Timestamp > ago(1d)
| project CreatedOn = Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, SHA1
| invoke FileProfile("SHA1", 500) 
| where GlobalPrevalence < 15
