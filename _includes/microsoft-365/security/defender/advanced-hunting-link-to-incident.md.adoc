== Link query results to an incident

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/microsoft-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender
* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

You can use the link to incident feature to add advanced hunting query results to a new or existing incident under investigation.
This feature helps you easily capture records from advanced hunting activities, which enables you to create a richer timeline or context of events regarding an incident.

=== Link results to new or existing incidents

. In the advanced hunting query page, first enter your query in the query field provided then select *Run query* to get your results.

. In the Results page, select the events or records that are related to a new or current investigation you're working on, then select *Link to incident*.

. Find the *Alert details* section in the Link to incident pane, then select *Create new incident* to convert the events to alerts and group them to a new incident:

+
Or select *Link to an existing incident* to add the selected records to an existing one.
Choose the related incident from the dropdown list of existing incidents.
You can also enter the first few characters of the incident name or ID to find the existing incident.

. For either selection, provide the following details, then select *Next*:
 ** *Alert title* - provide a descriptive title for the results that your incident responders can understand.
This descriptive title becomes the alert title.
 ** *Severity* - Choose the severity applicable to the group of alerts.
 ** *Category* - Choose the appropriate threat category for the alerts.
 ** *Description* - Give a helpful description for the grouped alerts.
 ** *Recommended actions* - Provide remediation actions.
. In the *Impacted entities* section, select the main affected or impacted entity.
Only the applicable entities based on the query results appear in this section.
In our example, we used a query to find events related to a possible email exfiltration incident, therefore the Sender is the impacted entity.
If there are four different senders, for instance, four alerts are created and linked to the chosen incident.

. Select *Next*.
. Review the details you've provided in the *Summary* section.
