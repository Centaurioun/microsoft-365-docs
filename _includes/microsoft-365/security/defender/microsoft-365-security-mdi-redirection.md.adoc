== Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Identity to Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE xref:../includes/microsoft-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender
* Defender for Identity

This guide explains how to route accounts to Microsoft 365 Defender by enabling automatic redirection from the former Microsoft Defender for Identity portal (portal.atp.azure.com), to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender].

=== What to expect

Once automatic redirection is enabled, accounts accessing the former Microsoft Defender for Identity portal at portal.atp.azure.com, will be automatically routed to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[security.microsoft.com].

=== When does this take effect?

Once enabled, this update might take effect almost immediately for some accounts.
But the redirection might take longer to propagate to every account in your organization.
Accounts in active sessions while this setting is applied won't be ejected from their session and will only be routed to Microsoft 365 Defender after ending their current session and signing back in again.

==== Set up portal redirection

To start routing accounts to Microsoft 365 Defender:

. Make sure you're a global administrator or have security administrator permissions in Azure Active Directory.
. Sign in to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender].
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Identities* > *General* > *Portal redirection* or https://security.microsoft.com/preferences2/portal_redirection[click here].

[!IMPORTANT] Enabling this setting will not terminate active user sessions.
Accounts who are in an active session while this setting is applied will only be directed to Microsoft 365 Defender after ending their current session and signing in again.

[!NOTE] You must be a global administrator or have security administrator permissions in Azure Active Directory to enable or disable this setting.

=== Can I go back to using the former portal?

If something isn't working for you or if there's anything you're unable to complete through Microsoft 365 Defender, we want to hear about it.
If you've encountered any issues with redirection, we encourage you to let us know by using the Give feedback submission form.

To revert to the former Microsoft Defender for Identity portal:

. Sign in to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender] as a global administrator or using and account with security administrator permissions in Azure Active directory.
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Identities* > *General* > *Portal redirection* or https://security.microsoft.com/preferences2/portal_redirection[open the page here].
. Toggle the Automatic redirection setting to *Off*.

This setting can be enabled again at any time.

Once disabled, accounts will no longer be routed to security.microsoft.com.
