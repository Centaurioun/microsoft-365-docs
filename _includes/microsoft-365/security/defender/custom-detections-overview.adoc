*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

With custom detections, you can proactively monitor for and respond to
various events and system states, including suspected breach activity
and misconfigured endpoints. This is made possible by customizable
detection rules that automatically trigger alerts as well as response
actions.

Custom detections work with link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced
hunting], which provides a powerful, flexible query language that covers
a broad set of event and system information from your network. You can
set them to run at regular intervals, generating alerts and taking
response actions whenever there are matches.

Custom detections provide: - Alerts for rule-based detections built from
advanced hunting queries - Automatic response actions
