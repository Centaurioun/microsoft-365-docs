The `DeviceInfo` table provides device information based on heartbeats,
which are periodic reports or signals from a device. Every fifteen
minutes, the device sends a partial heartbeat that contains frequently
changing attributes like `LoggedOnUsers`. Once a day, a full heartbeat
containing the deviceâ€™s attributes is sent.

You can use the following sample query to get the latest state of a
device:

[source,kusto]
----
// Get latest information on user/device
DeviceInfo
| where DeviceName == "example" and isnotempty(OSPlatform)
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
