Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/prerelease.md[Prerelease information]]

link:microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender] integrates
various Microsoft security services to provide centralized detection,
prevention, and investigation capabilities against sophisticated
attacks. This article describes the supported services, their licensing
requirements, the advantages and limitations associated with deploying
one or more services, and links to how you can fully deploy them
individually.

=== Supported services

A Microsoft 365 E5, E5 Security, A5, or A5 Security license or a valid
combination of licenses provides access to the following supported
services and entitles you to use Microsoft 365 Defender.
link:prerequisites.md#licensing-requirements[See licensing requirements]

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Supported service |Description
|Microsoft Defender for Endpoint |Endpoint protection suite built around
powerful behavioral sensors, cloud analytics, and threat intelligence

|Microsoft Defender for Office 365 |Advanced protection for your apps
and data in Office 365, including email and other collaboration tools

|Microsoft Defender for Identity |Defend against advanced threats,
compromised identities, and malicious insiders using correlated Active
Directory signals

|Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps |Identify and combat cyberthreats
across your Microsoft and third-party cloud services

=== Deployed services and functionality

Microsoft 365 Defender provides better visibility, correlation, and
remediation as you deploy more supported services.

==== Benefits of full deployment

To get the complete benefits of Microsoft 365 Defender, we recommend
deploying all supported services. Here are some of the key benefits of
full deployment:

* Incidents are identified and correlated based on alerts and event
signals from all available sensors and service-specific analysis
capabilities
* Automated investigation and remediation (AIR) playbooks apply across
various entity types, including devices, mailboxes, and user accounts
* A more comprehensive advanced hunting schema can be queried for event
and entity data from devices, mailboxes, and other entities

==== Limited deployment scenarios

Each supported service that you deploy provides an extremely rich set of
raw signals as well as correlated information. While limited deployment
doesn’t cause Microsoft 365 Defender functionality to turn off, its
ability to provide comprehensive visibility across your endpoints, apps,
data, and identities is affected. At the same time, any remediation
capabilities only apply to entities that can be managed by the services
you’ve deployed.

The table below lists how each supported service provides additional
data, opportunities to obtain additional insight by correlating the
data, and better remediation and response capabilities.

|===
|Service |Data (signals & correlated info) |Remediation & response scope
|Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | |Endpoints
|Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | |
|Microsoft Defender for Identity | |Identities
|Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps | |Cloud apps

=== Deploy the services

Deploying each service typically requires provisioning to your tenant
and some initial configuration. See the following table to understand
how each of these services is deployed.
