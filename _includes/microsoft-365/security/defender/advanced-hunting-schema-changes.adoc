== Advanced hunting schema - Naming changes

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/prerelease.md[Prerelease information]]

The link:advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md[advanced hunting schema] is
updated regularly to add new tables and columns. In some cases, existing
columns names are renamed or replaced to improve the user experience.
Refer to this article to review naming changes that could impact your
queries.

Naming changes are automatically applied to queries that are saved in
the Defender for Cloud, including queries used by custom detection
rules. You don’t need to update these queries manually. However, you
will need to update the following queries: - Queries that are run using
the API - Queries that are saved elsewhere outside the Defender for
Cloud
