also help in properly classifying the overall incident.

you must have access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal so that you
can:

* Assess and review the generated alerts and associated incidents. See
link:investigate-alerts.md[investigate alerts].
* Search your tenantâ€™s security signal data and check for potential
threats and suspicious activities. See
link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting].

[!Note] You can provide feedback to Microsoft about true positive and
false positives alerts, not only at the end of the investigation, but
also during the investigation process. This can help Microsoft with
future analysis and classification of security events.
