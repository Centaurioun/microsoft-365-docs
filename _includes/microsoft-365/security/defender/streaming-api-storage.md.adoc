*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804[Microsoft 365 Defender]

[!includexref:../../includes/prerelease.adoc[Prerelease information]]

=== Before you begin

. Create a link:/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview[Storage account] in your tenant.
. Log in to your https://ms.portal.azure.com/[Azure tenant], go to menu:Subscriptions[Your subscription > Resource Providers > Register to Microsoft.Insights].

==== Add contributor permissions

Once the Storage account is created you will need to:

. Define the user who will be logging into Microsoft 365 Defender as Contributor.
+
Go to menu:Storage Account[Access control (IAM) > Add] and verify under *Role assignments*.

=== Enable raw data streaming

. Log in to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender] as a *_Global Administrator_* or *_Security Administrator_*.
. Go to *Settings* > *Microsoft 365 Defender* > *Streaming API*.
To go directly to the *Streaming API* page, use https://security.microsoft.com/settings/mtp_settings/raw_data_export.
. Click *Add*.
. In the *Add new Streaming API settings* flyout that appears, configure the following settings:
 .. *Name*: Choose a name for your new settings.
 .. Select *Forward events to Azure Storage*.
 .. In the *Storage Account Resource ID* box that appears, type your *Storage Account Resource ID*.
To get your *Storage Account Resource ID*, open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, click *Storage accounts* > go to the properties tab > copy the text under *Storage Account Resource ID*.

 .. Back on the *Add new Streaming API settings* flyout, choose the *Event types* that you want to stream.

+
When you're finished, click *Submit*.

=== The schema of the events in the Storage account

* A blob container will be created for each event type:
+
:::image type="content" source="../defender-endpoint/images/storage-account-event-schema.png" alt-text="Example of a blob container" lightbox="../defender-endpoint/images/storage-account-event-schema.png":::

* The schema of each row in a blob is the following JSON:
+
[,json]
----
{
        "time": "<The time Microsoft 365 Defender received the event>"
        "tenantId": "<Your tenant ID>"
        "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
        "properties": { <Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
}
----

* Each blob contains multiple rows.
* Each row contains the event name, the time Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you will only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "properties".
* For more information about the schema of Microsoft 365 Defender events, see xref:../defender/advanced-hunting-overview.adoc[Advanced Hunting overview].

=== Data types mapping

In order to get the data types for our events properties do the following:

. Log in to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender] and go to *Hunting* > *Advanced hunting*.
To go directly to the *Advanced hunting* page, use <security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting>.
. On the *Query* tab, run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event:
+
[,text]
----
{EventType}
| getschema
| project ColumnName, ColumnType
----

* Here is an example for Device Info event:
