== Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Identity to Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender
* Defender for Identity

This guide explains how to route accounts to Microsoft 365 Defender by
enabling automatic redirection from the former Microsoft Defender for
Identity portal (portal.atp.azure.com), to Microsoft 365 Defender.

=== What to expect

Starting January 31, 2023, the portal redirection setting will be
automatically enabled for each tenant. Once the redirection setting is
enabled, any requests to the standalone Defender for Identity portal
(`portal.atp.azure.com`) will be redirected to Microsoft 365 Defender
(https://security.microsoft.com) along with any direct links to its
functionality. Accounts accessing the former Microsoft Defender for
Identity portal will be automatically routed to the Microsoft 365
Defender portal.

=== When does this take effect?

Once enabled, this update might take effect almost immediately for some
accounts. But the redirection might take longer to propagate to every
account in your organization. Accounts in active sessions while this
setting is applied won’t be ejected from their session and will only be
routed to Microsoft 365 Defender after ending their current session and
signing back in again.

==== Set up portal redirection

To start routing accounts to Microsoft 365 Defender:

[arabic]
. Make sure you’re a global administrator or have security administrator
permissions in Azure Active Directory.
. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Defender.
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Identities* > *General* > *Portal
redirection* or
https://security.microsoft.com/preferences2/portal_redirection[go here].

. Toggle the Automatic redirection setting to *On*.

[!IMPORTANT] Enabling this setting will not terminate active user
sessions. Accounts who are in an active session while this setting is
applied will only be directed to Microsoft 365 Defender after ending
their current session and signing in again.

=== Can I go back to using the former portal?

If something isn’t working for you or if there’s anything you’re unable
to complete through Microsoft 365 Defender, we want to hear about it. If
you’ve encountered any issues with redirection, we encourage you to let
us know by using the Give feedback submission form.

To revert to the former Microsoft Defender for Identity portal:

[arabic]
. Sign in to Microsoft 365 Defender as a global administrator or using
and account with security administrator permissions in Azure Active
directory.
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Identities* > *General* > *Portal
redirection* or
https://security.microsoft.com/preferences2/portal_redirection[open the
page here].
. Toggle the Automatic redirection setting to *Off*.

This setting can be enabled again at any time.

Once disabled, accounts will no longer be routed to
security.microsoft.com.
