*Applies to:*

* Microsoft 365 Defender
* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

xref:advanced-hunting-overview.adoc[Advanced hunting] queries can be shared among users in the same organization.
You can also save queries that are only accessible to you.
You can also find community queries that are shared publicly on GitHub.
These saved queries let you quickly pursue specific threat hunting scenarios without having to write queries from scratch.

Under the Queries tab in advanced hunting, you can find the drop-down menus for *Shared queries*, *My queries*, and *Community queries*.
You can select a downward-facing arrow to expand a menu.

Community queries are grouped into folders like _Campaigns_, _Collection_, _Defense evasion_, and the like.
Further information about the query is provided as in-line comments in the query itself.
