____
[!IMPORTANT] The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table is currently in beta and is being offered on a short-term basis to allow you to hunt through Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in events.
Customers need to have an Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license to collect and view activities for this table.
Microsoft will eventually move all sign-in schema information to the `IdentityLogonEvents` table.
____

The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table in the advanced hunting schema contains information about Azure Active Directory service principal and managed identity sign-ins.
You can learn more about the different kinds of sign-ins in link:/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins[Azure Active Directory sign-in activity reports - preview].

Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-hunting-reference[the advanced hunting reference].
