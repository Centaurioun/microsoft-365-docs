== Address false positives or false negatives in Microsoft 365 Defender

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

False positives or negatives can occasionally occur with any threat
protection solution. If link:m365d-autoir.md[automated investigation and
response capabilities] in Microsoft 365 Defender missed or wrongly
detected something, there are steps your security operations team can
take:

* link:#report-a-false-positivenegative-to-microsoft-for-analysis[Report
a false positive/negative to Microsoft]
* link:#adjust-an-alert-to-prevent-false-positives-from-recurring[Adjust
your alerts] (if needed)
* link:#undo-a-remediation-action-that-was-taken-on-a-device[Undo
remediation actions that were taken on devices]

The following sections describe how to perform these tasks.
