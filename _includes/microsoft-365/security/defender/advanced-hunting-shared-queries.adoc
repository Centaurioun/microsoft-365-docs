== Use shared queries in advanced hunting

{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365
Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[Advanced hunting] queries can be
shared among users in the same organization. You can also save queries
that are only accessible to you. You can also find community queries
that are shared publicly on GitHub. These saved queries let you quickly
pursue specific threat hunting scenarios without having to write queries
from scratch.

Under the Queries tab in advanced hunting, you can find the drop-down
menus for *Shared queries*, *My queries*, and *Community queries*. You
can select a downward-facing arrow to expand a menu.

public repository on GitHub]. Contributions to this repository are
reviewed before getting published. To contribute,

the query is provided as in-line comments in the query itself.
