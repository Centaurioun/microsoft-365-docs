== AADSpnSignInEventsBeta

*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

____
[!IMPORTANT] The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table is currently in beta and
is being offered on a short-term basis to allow you to hunt through
Azure Active Directory (AAD) sign-in events. Customers need to have an
Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license to collect and view activities
for this table. Microsoft will eventually move all sign-in schema
information to the `IdentityLogonEvents` table.
____

The `AADSpnSignInEventsBeta` table in the advanced hunting schema
contains information about Azure Active Directory service principal and
managed identity sign-ins. You can learn more about the different kinds
of sign-ins in
link:/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins[Azure
Active Directory sign-in activity reports - preview].

Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the
table.

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/advanced-hunting-reference[the
advanced hunting reference].
