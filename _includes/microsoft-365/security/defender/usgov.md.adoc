== Microsoft 365 Defender for US Government customers

However, there are some differences in the availability of capabilities for this offering.

____
[!NOTE] If you are a GCC customer using Defender for Cloud Apps, Defender for Endpoint, or Defender for Identity in Commercial, you need to transition those services to their GCC versions to be eligible for Microsoft 365 Defender GCC.
