== Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint evaluation environment

This article will guide you through the steps on setting up the evaluation environment for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using production devices.

____
[!TIP] Microsoft Defender for Endpoint also comes with an in-product evaluation lab where you can add pre-configured devices and run simulations to evaluate the capabilities of the platform.
The lab comes with a simplified set-up experience that can help quickly demonstrate the value of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint including guidance for many features like advanced hunting and threat analytics.
For more information, see xref:../defender-endpoint/evaluation-lab.adoc[Evaluate capabilities].
+ The main difference between the guidance provided in this article and the evaluation lab is the evaluation environment uses production devices whereas the evaluation lab uses non-production devices.
____

Use the following steps to enable the evaluation for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

=== Step 1. Check license state

You'll first need to check the license state to verify that it was properly provisioned.
You can do this through the admin center or through the *Microsoft Azure portal*.

. To view your licenses, go to the *Microsoft Azure portal* and navigate to the https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Products[Microsoft Azure portal license section].

. Alternately, in the admin center, navigate to *Billing* > *Subscriptions*.
+
On the screen, you'll see all the provisioned licenses and their current *Status*.

=== Step 2. Onboard endpoints using any of the supported management tools

After verifying that the license state has been provisioned properly, you can start onboarding devices to the service.

For the purpose of evaluating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, we recommend choosing a couple of Windows devices to conduct the evaluation on.

You can choose to use any of the supported management tools, but Intune provides optimal integration.

The xref:../defender-endpoint/deployment-strategy.adoc[Plan deployment] topic outlines the general steps you need to take to deploy Defender for Endpoint.

Watch this video for a quick overview of the onboarding process and learn about the available tools and methods.
