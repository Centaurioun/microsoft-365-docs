link:./microsoft-365-defender.md[Microsoft 365 Defender] at
https://security.microsoft.com combines security capabilities from
existing Microsoft security portals, including the Security & Compliance
Center. This improved center helps security teams protect their
organization from threats more effectively and efficiently.

If you’re familiar with the Security & Compliance Center
(protection.office.com), this article describes some of the changes and
improvements in Microsoft 365 Defender.

Learn more about the benefits: link:microsoft-365-defender.md[Overview
of Microsoft 365 Defender]

If you’re looking for compliance-related items, visit the Microsoft
Purview compliance portal.

=== New and improved capabilities

The left navigation, or quick launch bar, will look familiar. However,
there are some new and updated elements in this Defender for Cloud.

With the unified Microsoft 365 Defender solution, you can stitch
together the threat signals and determine the full scope and impact of
the threat, and how it’s currently impacting the organization.

converged experience.]

Defender for Office 365 safeguards your organization against malicious
threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools.

image::../../media/mdo-m365d-nav.png[The Defender for Office 365
portal.]

==== Incidents and alerts

Brings together incident and alert management across your email,
devices, and identities. Alerts are now available under the
Investigation node, and help provide a broader view of an attack. The
alert page provides full context to the alert, by combining attack
signals to construct a detailed story. Previously, alerts were specific
to different workloads. A new, unified experience now brings together a
consistent view of alerts across workloads. You can quickly triage,
investigate, and take effective action.

launch bar in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.]

==== Hunting

Proactively search for threats, malware, and malicious activity across
your endpoints, Office 365 mailboxes, and more by using
link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting queries]. These
powerful queries can be used to locate and review threat indicators and
entities for both known and potential threats.

link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/custom-detection-rules[Custom
detection rules] can be built from advanced hunting queries to help you
proactively watch for events that might be indicative of breach activity
and misconfigured devices.

Here’s an link:advanced-hunting-example.md[example on advanced hunting]
in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

==== Action center

Action center shows you the investigations created by automated
investigation and response capabilities. This automated, self-healing in
Microsoft 365 Defender can help security teams by automatically
responding to specific events.

Learn more about link:m365d-action-center.md[Action center].

===== Threat Analytics

Get threat intelligence from expert Microsoft security researchers.
Threat Analytics helps security teams be more efficient when facing
emerging threats. Threat Analytics includes:

* Email-related detections and mitigations from Microsoft Defender for
Office 365. This is in addition to the endpoint data already available
from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
* Incidents view related to the threats.
* Enhanced experience for quickly identifying and using actionable
information in the reports.

You can access Threat analytics either from the upper left navigation
bar in Microsoft 365 Defender, or from a dedicated dashboard card that
shows the top threats for your organization.

Learn more about how to link:./threat-analytics.md[track and respond to
emerging threats with threat analytics].

==== Email & collaboration

Track and investigate threats to your users’ email, track campaigns, and
more. If you’ve used the Security & Compliance Center, this will be
familiar.

collab, on the left navigation pane in the Microsoft 365 Defender
portal.]

===== Email entity page

The link:../office-365-security/mdo-email-entity-page.md[Email entity
page] _unifies_ email information that had been scattered across
different pages or views in the past. Investigating email for threats
and trends is _centralized_. Header information and email preview are
accessible through the same email page, along with other useful
email-related information. Likewise, the detonation status for malicious
file attachments or URLs can be found on a tab of the same page. The
Email entity page empowers admins and security operations teams to
understand an email threat and its status, fast, and then act quickly
determine handling.

==== Access and Reports

View reports, change your settings, and modify user roles.

Microsoft 365 Defender permissions and reporting, on the left navigation
pane in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.]
