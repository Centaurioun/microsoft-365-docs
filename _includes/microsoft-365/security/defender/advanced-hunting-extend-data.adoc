=== Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor on the domain controller

If youâ€™re running Active Directory on premises, you need to install the
Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor on the domain controller to get
data for Microsoft Defender for Identity. When installed and properly
configured, this data also feeds into advanced hunting through Microsoft
Defender for Identity and provides a more holistic picture of identity
information and events in your network. This data also enhances the
ability of Microsoft Defender for Identity to generate relevant alerts
that are also covered by advanced hunting.
