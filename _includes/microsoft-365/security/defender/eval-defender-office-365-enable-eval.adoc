=== Step 1: Audit and verify the public MX record

To effectively evaluate Microsoft Defender for Office 365, it’s
important that inbound external email is relayed through the Exchange
Online Protection (EOP) instance associated with your tenant.

[arabic]
. In the M365 Admin Portal at https://admin.microsoft.com, expand _…Show
all_ if necessary, expand _Settings_, and then select *Domains*. Or, to
go directly to the _Domains_ page, use
https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/Domains.
. On the _Domains_ page, select your verified email domain by clicking
anywhere on the entry other than the check box.
. In the domain details flyout that opens, select the *DNS records* tab.
Make note of the MX record that’s generated and assigned to your EOP
tenant.
. Access your external (public) DNS zone and check the primary MX record
associated with your email domain:
* _If your public MX record currently matches the assigned EOP address
(for example, contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com) then no further
routing changes should be required_.
* If your public MX record currently resolves to a third-party or
on-premises SMTP gateway then additional routing configurations may be
required.
* If your public MX record currently resolves to on-premises Exchange
then you may still be in a hybrid model where some recipient mailbox
have not yet been migrated to EXO.

=== Step 2: Audit accepted domains

[arabic]
. In the Exchange admin center (EAC) at
https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com, expand _Mail flow_, and then click
*Accepted domains*.Or, to go directly to the _Accepted domains_ page,
use https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/accepteddomains.
. On the _Accepted domains_ page, make note of the *Domain type* value
for your primary email domain.
* If the domain type is set to *Authoritative* then it is assumed all
recipient mailboxes for your organization currently reside in Exchange
Online.
* If the domain type is set to *InternalRelay* then you may still be in
a hybrid model where some recipient mailboxes still reside on-premises.

=== Step 3: Audit inbound connectors

[arabic]
. In the Exchange admin center (EAC) at
https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com, expand _Mail flow_, and then click
*Connectors*. Or, to go directly to the _Connectors_ page, use
https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/connectors.
. On the _Connectors_ page, make note of any connectors with the
following settings:
* The *From* value is *Partner org* that might correlate to a
third-party SMTP gateway.
* The *From* value is *Your org* that might indicate you’re still in a
hybrid scenario.

=== Step 4: Activate the evaluation

Use the instructions here to activate your Microsoft Defender for Office
365 evaluation from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

For detailed information, see
link:../office-365-security/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365.md[Try
Microsoft Defender for Office 365].

[arabic]
. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com
expand _Email & collaboration_ > select *Policies & rules* > select
*Threat policies* > scroll down to the _Others_ section, and then select
*Evaluation mode*. Or, to go directly to the _Evaluation mode_ page, use
https://security.microsoft.com/atpEvaluation.
. On the _Evaluation mode_ page, click *Start evaluation*.

lightbox=``../../media/mdo-eval/mdo-eval-activate-eval_07.png'':::
. In the _Help us understand your mail flow_ dialog, one of the
following options is automatically selected based on our detection of
the MX record for your domain:
* *I’m only using Microsoft Exchange Online*: The MX records for your
domain point to Microsoft 365. There’s nothing left to configure, so
click *Finish*.

lightbox=``../../media/mdo-eval/mdo-eval-activate-eval_08a.png'':::
* *I’m using a third-party and/or on-premises service provider*: In the
upcoming screens, select the vendor name along with the inbound
connector that accepts mail from that solution. You also decide if you
need an Exchange Online mail flow rule (also known as a transport rule)
that skips spam filtering for incoming messages from the third-party
protection service or device. When you’re finished, click *Finish*.
