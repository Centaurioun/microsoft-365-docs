*Applies to:* - Microsoft 365 Defender

The `IdentityDirectoryEvents` table in the
link:advanced-hunting-overview.md[advanced hunting] schema contains
events involving an on-premises domain controller running Active
Directory (AD). This table captures various identity-related events,
like password changes, password expiration, and user principal name
(UPN) changes. It also captures system events on the domain controller,
like scheduling of tasks and PowerShell activity. Use this reference to
construct queries that return information from this table.

[!TIP] For detailed information about the events types (`ActionType`
values) supported by a table, use the built-in schema reference
available in the Defender for Cloud.
