When you evaluate Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you might choose to pilot specific users before enabling and enforcing policies for your entire organization.
Creating distribution groups can help manage the deployment processes.
For example, create groups such as _Defender for Office 365 Users - Standard Protection_, _Defender for Office 365 Users - Strict Protection_, _Defender for Office 365 Users - Custom Protection_, or _Defender for Office 365 Users - Exceptions_.

It might not be evident why 'Standard' and 'Strict' are the terms used for these groups, but that will become clear when you explore more about Defender for Office 365 security presets.
Naming groups 'custom' and 'exceptions' speak for themselves, and though most of your users should fall under _standard_ and _strict_, custom and exception groups will collect valuable data for you regarding managing risk.

=== Step 1: Create pilot groups

Distribution groups can be created and defined directly in Exchange Online or synchronized from on-premises Active Directory.

. Sign in to the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) at https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com using an account that has been granted Recipient Administrator role or been delegated group management permissions.
. Go to *Recipients* > *Groups*.
+
:::image type="content" source="../../media/mdo-eval/1_mdo-eval-pilot.png" alt-text=" The Groups menu item to be clicked." lightbox="../../media/mdo-eval/1_mdo-eval-pilot.png":::

. On the *Groups* page, select image:../../media/m365-cc-sc-add-internal-icon.png[Add a group icon.] *Add a group*.

. On the remaining pages, assign an owner, add members to the group, set the email address, join-depart restrictions, and other settings.

=== Step 2: Configure protection

Some capabilities in Defender for Office 365 are configured and turned on by default, but security operations might want to raise the level of protection from the default.

Some capabilities are _not yet_ configured.
You have the following options for configuring protection:

* *Assign users to preset security policies*: xref:../office-365-security/preset-security-policies.adoc[Preset security policies] are provided as a method to quickly assign a uniform level of protection across all of the capabilities.
You can choose from *Standard* or *Strict* protection.
The advantage here is that you protect groups of users as quickly as possible.
This disadvantage here is that you can't customize most of the settings in preset security policies (for example, you can't change an action from *Deliver to recipients' Junk Email folders* to *Quarantine* or vice-versa).
Also keep in mind that preset security policies are _always_ applied before custom policies.
So, if you want to create and use any custom policies, you'll need to exclude users in those custom policies from preset security policies.
* *Configure _custom_ protection policies*: If you prefer to configure the environment yourself, you can quickly achieve a _baseline_ of protection by following the guidance in xref:../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.adoc[Protect against threats].
With this approach, you get to learn more about the settings that are configurable.
And, you can fine-tune the policies later.
+
You can also build and assign custom protection policies as part of your evaluation.
Before you start customizing policies, it's important to understand the precedence in which these protection policies are applied and enforced.
Security operations will need to create and/or configure some policies, even if when the preset is applied.

* *Assign preset security policies automatically*: xref:../office-365-security/preset-security-policies.adoc[Preset security policies] are provided as a method to quickly assign a uniform level of protection across all of the capabilities.
You can choose from *_Standard_* or *_Strict_*.
A good approach is to start with preset security policies and then fine-tune the policies as you learn more about the capabilities and your own unique threat environment.
The advantage here is that you protect groups of users as quickly as possible, with the ability to tweak protection afterward.
(This method is recommended.)
* *Configure baseline protection manually*: If you prefer to configure the environment yourself, you can quickly achieve a _baseline_ of protection by following the guidance in xref:../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.adoc[Protect against threats].
With this approach, you get to learn more about the settings that are configurable.
And, you can fine-tune the policies later.
* *Configure _custom_ protection policies*: You can also build and assign custom protection policies as part of your evaluation.
Before you start customizing policies, it's important to understand the precedence in which these protection policies are applied and enforced.
Security ops will need to create some policies even if when the preset is applied, in specific in order to define security policies for Safe Links and Safe Attachments.

____
[!IMPORTANT] *If you need to configure custom protection policies*, you should examine the values that make up the *Standard* and *Strict* security definitions here: xref:../office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365.adoc[Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security].
Default values, as seen before any configuration takes place are also listed.
Keep a spreadsheet of where your custom build deviates.
____

==== Assign preset security policies

We recommended you begin with the _recommended baseline policies_ when evaluating MDO and then refine them as needed over the course of your evaluation period.

You can enable preset security policies in EOP and Defender for Office 365 fast, and assign them to specific pilot users or defined groups as part of your evaluation.
Preset policies offer a baseline *Standard* protection template or a more aggressive *Strict* protection template, which can be assigned independently.

For example, an EOP condition for pilot evaluations could be applied if the recipients are _members_ of a defined _EOP Standard Protection_ group, and then managed by adding accounts to, or removing account from, the group.

Likewise, a Defender for Office 365 condition for pilot evaluations could be applied if the recipients are _members_ of a defined _Defender for Office 365 Standard Protection_ group and then managed by adding / removing accounts via the group.

For complete instructions, see link:../office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users[Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users].

==== Configure custom protection policies

The pre-defined _Standard_ or _Strict_ Defender for Office 365 policy templates give your pilot users the recommended baseline protection.
However, you can also build and assign custom protection policies as part of your evaluation.

It's _important_ to be aware of the precedence these protection policies take when applied and enforced, as explained in xref:../office-365-security/how-policies-and-protections-are-combined.adoc[Order and precedence of email protection - Office 365] and link:../office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md#order-of-precedence-for-preset-security-policies-and-other-policies[Order of precedence for preset security policies and other policies].

=== Step 3: Try out capabilities and get familiar with simulation, monitoring, and metrics

Now that your pilot is set up and configured, it's helpful to become familiar with the reporting, monitoring, and attack simulation tools that are unique to Microsoft Defender for Microsoft 365.

|===
| Capability | Description | More information

| Threat Explorer
| Threat Explorer is a powerful near real-time tool to help Security Operations teams investigate and respond to threats and displays information about suspected malware and phish in email and files in Office 365, as well as other security threats and risks to your organization.
| xref:../office-365-security/threat-explorer-views.adoc[Views in Threat Explorer and real-time detections]

| Attack simulation training
| You can use Attack simulation training in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to run realistic attack scenarios in your organization, which help you identify and find vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your environment.
| xref:../office-365-security/attack-simulation-training-get-started.adoc[Get started using Attack simulation training]

| Reports dashboard
| On the left navigation menu, click Reports and expand the Email & collaboration heading.
The Email & collaboration reports are about spotting security trends some of which will allow you to take action (through buttons like 'Go to submissions'), and others that will show trends.
These metrics are generated automatically.
