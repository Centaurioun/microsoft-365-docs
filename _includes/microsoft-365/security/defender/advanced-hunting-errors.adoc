Advanced hunting displays errors to notify for syntax mistakes and
whenever queries hit link:advanced-hunting-limits.md[predefined quotas
and usage parameters]. Refer to the table below for tips on how to
resolve or avoid errors.

|===
|Error type |Cause |Resolution |Error message examples
|Syntax errors |The query contains unrecognized names, including
references to nonexistent operators, columns, functions, or tables.
|Ensure references to link:/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/[Kusto
operators and functions] are correct. Check
link:advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md[the schema] for the correct
advanced hunting columns, functions, and tables. Enclose variable
strings in quotes so they are recognized. While writing your queries,
use the autocomplete suggestions from IntelliSense.
|`A recognition error occurred.`

|Semantic errors |While the query uses valid operator, column, function,
or table names, there are errors in its structure and resulting logic.
In some cases, advanced hunting identifies the specific operator that
caused the error. |Check for errors in the structure of query. Refer to
link:/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/[Kusto documentation] for
guidance. While writing your queries, use the autocomplete suggestions
from IntelliSense.
|`'project' operator: Failed to resolve scalar expression named 'x'`

|Timeouts |A query can only run within a
link:advanced-hunting-limits.md[limited period before timing out]. This
error can happen more frequently when running complex queries.
|link:advanced-hunting-best-practices.md[Optimize the query]
|`Query exceeded the timeout period.`

|CPU throttling |Queries in the same tenant have exceeded the
link:advanced-hunting-limits.md[CPU resources] that have been allocated
based on tenant size. |The service checks CPU resource usage every 15
minutes and daily and displays warnings after usage exceeds 10% of the
allocated quota. If you reach 100% utilization, the service blocks
queries until after the next daily or 15-minute cycle.
link:advanced-hunting-best-practices.md[Optimize your queries to avoid
hitting CPU quotas] |-
`This query used X% of your organization's allocated resources for the current 15 minutes.`-
`You have exceeded processing resources allocated to this tenant. You can run queries again in <duration>.`

|Result size limit exceeded |The aggregate size of the result set for
the query has exceeded the maximum size. This error can occur if the
result set is so large that truncation at the 10,000-record limit can’t
reduce it to an acceptable size. Results that have multiple columns with
sizable content are more likely to be impacted by this error.
|link:advanced-hunting-best-practices.md[Optimize the query]
|`Result size limit exceeded. Use "summarize" to aggregate results, "project" to drop uninteresting columns, or "take" to truncate results.`

|Excessive resource consumption |The query has consumed excessive
amounts of resources and has been stopped from completing. In some
cases, advanced hunting identifies the specific operator that wasn’t
optimized. |link:advanced-hunting-best-practices.md[Optimize the query]
|-`Query stopped due to excessive resource consumption.`-`Query stopped. Adjust use of the <operator name> operator to avoid excessive resource consumption.`

|Unknown errors |The query failed because of an unknown reason. |Try
running the query again. Contact Microsoft through the portal if queries
continue to return unknown errors.
|`An unexpected error occurred during query execution. Please try again in a few minutes.`
