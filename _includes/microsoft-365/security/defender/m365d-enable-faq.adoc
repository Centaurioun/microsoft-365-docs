=== I donâ€™t have a Microsoft 365 E5 license. Can I still use Microsoft 365 Defender?

Defender:

* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

=== Do I need to install or deploy anything to start using Microsoft 365 Defender?

No, Microsoft 365 Defender consolidates data from Microsoft 365 security
services that you have already deployed. Once you turn it on, incident,
automation, and hunting experiences will start working within the scope
of the deployed products. If none of these products are properly
deployed, Microsoft 365 Defender will not display any data and is unable
to take any action.

To optimize your Microsoft 365 Defender experiences, we recommend
deploying _all_ supported link:deploy-supported-services.md[Microsoft
365 security products and services].

=== Where does Microsoft 365 Defender process and store my data?

Microsoft 365 Defender automatically selects an optimal location for the
data center where consolidated data is processed and stored. If you have
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, it selects the same location used by
Defender for Endpoint.

____
[!NOTE] Microsoft Defender for Endpoint automatically provisions in
European Union (EU) data centers when turned on through Microsoft
Defender for Cloud. Microsoft 365 Defender will automatically provision
in the same EU data center for customers who have provisioned Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint in this manner.
____

The data center location is shown before and after the service is
provisioned in the settings page for Microsoft 365 Defender (*Settings >
Microsoft 365 Defender*). If you prefer to use another data center
location, select *Need help?* in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to
contact Microsoft support.
