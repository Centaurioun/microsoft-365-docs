While you are going through
link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
on macOS] and link:mac-install-manually.md[Manual deployment] testing or
a Proof Of Concept (PoC), you might get the following error:

:::image type=``content'' source=``images/no-license-found.png''
alt-text=``License error'' lightbox=``images/no-license-found.png'':::

==== Message:

No license found

Looks like your organization does not have a license for Microsoft 365
Enterprise subscription.

Contact your administrator for help.

==== Cause:

You deployed and/or installed the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on
macOS package (``Download installation package''), but you might not
have run the configuration script (``Download onboarding package''), or
you have not assigned a license to the user.

You can also encounter this error when the Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint on macOS agent isn’t up to date.

==== Solution:

Follow the MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.py instructions
documented here:
link:mac-install-manually.md#client-configuration[Client configuration].

For scenarios where Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS isn’t up to
date, you’ll need to update the agent.

==== Cause:

You downloaded and installed

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
