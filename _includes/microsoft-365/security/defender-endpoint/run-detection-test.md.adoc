When you add a device to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service for management, this is also called onboarding devices.
Onboarding allows devices to report signals about their health status to the service.

Making sure, or verifying, that a device has been added to the service successfully is a critical step in the entire deployment process.
It assures that all the devices expected are being managed.

=== Verify Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding of a device using a PowerShell detection test

Run the following PowerShell script on a newly onboarded device to verify that it is properly reporting to the Defender for Endpoint service.

. Open an elevated command-line prompt on the device and run the script:
 .. Go to *Start* and type *cmd*.
 .. Right-click *Command Prompt* and select *Run as administrator*.
+
:::image type="content" source="images/run-as-admin.png" alt-text="The Start menu pointing to Run as administrator" lightbox="images/run-as-admin.png":::
. At the prompt, copy and run the following command:
+
[,powershell]
----
powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference = 'silentlycontinue';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe');Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
----

The Command Prompt window will close automatically.
If successful, a new alert will appear in the portal for the onboarded device in about ten minutes.
