* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

Microsoft Defender Antivirus uses several methods to provide threat
protection:

* Cloud protection for near-instant detection and blocking of new and
emerging threats
* Always-on scanning, using file and process behavior monitoring and
other heuristics (also known as ``real-time protection'')
* Dedicated protection updates based on machine learning, human and
automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research

You can configure how Microsoft Defender Antivirus uses these methods
with Group Policy, System Center Configuration Manage, PowerShell
cmdlets, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

This section covers configuration for always-on scanning, including how
to detect and block apps that are deemed unsafe, but may not be detected
as malware.

See link:cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Use next-gen
Microsoft Defender Antivirus technologies through cloud protection] for
how to enable and configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud
protection.
