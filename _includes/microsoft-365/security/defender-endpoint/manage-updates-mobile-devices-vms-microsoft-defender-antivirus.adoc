*Platforms* - Windows

Mobile devices and VMs may require more configuration to ensure
performance is not impacted by updates.

There are two settings that are useful for these devices:

* Opt in to Microsoft Update on mobile computers without a WSUS
connection
* Prevent Security intelligence updates when running on battery power

=== Opt in to Microsoft Update on mobile computers without a WSUS connection

You can use Microsoft Update to keep Security intelligence on mobile
devices running Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date when they are
not connected to the corporate network or don’t otherwise have a WSUS
connection.

This means that protection updates can be delivered to devices (via
Microsoft Update) even if you have set WSUS to override Microsoft
Update.

You can opt in to Microsoft Update on the mobile device in one of the
following ways:

* Change the setting with Group Policy.
* Use a VBScript to create a script, then run it on each computer in
your network.
* Manually opt in every computer on your network through the *Settings*
menu.

==== Use Group Policy to opt in to Microsoft Update

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management machine, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want
to configure and select *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer
configuration*.
. Select *Policies* then *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender
Antivirus* > *Signature Updates*.
. Set *Allow security intelligence updates from Microsoft Update* to
*Enabled*, and then select *OK*.

==== Use a VBScript to opt in to Microsoft Update

[arabic]
. Use the instructions in the MSDN article
link:/windows/win32/wua_sdk/opt-in-to-microsoft-update[Opt-In to
Microsoft Update] to create the VBScript.
. Run the VBScript you created on each computer in your network.

==== Manually opt in to Microsoft Update

[arabic]
. Open *Windows Update* in *Update & security* settings on the computer
you want to opt in.
. Select *Advanced* options.
. Select the checkbox for *Give me updates for other Microsoft products
when I update Windows*.

=== Prevent Security intelligence updates when running on battery power

You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus to only download
protection updates when the PC is connected to a wired power source.

==== Use Group Policy to prevent security intelligence updates on battery power

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management machine, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console], choose the Group Policy Object you want to
configure, and open it for editing.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer
configuration*.
. Select *Policies* then *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender
Antivirus* > *Signature Updates*, and then set *Allow security
intelligence updates when running on battery power* to *Disabled*. Then
select *OK*.

This action prevents protection updates from downloading when the PC is
on battery power.
