== Prevent or allow users to locally modify Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy settings

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

By default, Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings that are deployed via
a Group Policy Object to the endpoints in your network will prevent
users from locally changing the settings. You can change this
configuration in some instances. For example, it might be necessary to
allow certain user groups, such as security researchers and threat
investigators, to have further control over individual settings on the
endpoints they use.

=== Configure local overrides for Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings

The default setting for these local override policies is *Disabled*.

If the policies are set to *Enabled*, users can make changes to the
associated settings on their devices by using the
link:microsoft-defender-security-center-antivirus.md[Windows Security]
app, local Group Policy settings, or PowerShell cmdlets (where
appropriate).

The link:#table-of-settings[table of settings section] lists override
policy settings and the configuration instructions.

To configure these settings:

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management computer, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want
to configure and then select *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration*
and select *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender
Antivirus* and then the *Location* specified in the
link:#table-of-settings[table of settings section] (in this article).
. Double-click the policy *Setting* as specified in the table below, and
set the option to your desired configuration. Select *OK*, and repeat
for any other settings.
. Deploy the Group Policy Object as usual.

=== Configure how locally and globally defined threat remediation and exclusions lists are merged

You can also configure how locally defined lists are combined or merged
with globally defined lists. This setting applies to
link:configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[exclusion
lists],
link:configure-remediation-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[specified
remediation lists], and
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction[attack
surface reduction].

By default, lists that have been configured in local group policy and
the Windows Security app are merged with lists that are defined by the
appropriate Group Policy Object that you have deployed on your network.
Where there are conflicts, the globally defined list takes precedence.
You can disable this setting to ensure that only globally-defined lists
(such as those from any deployed GPOs) are used.

==== Use Group Policy to disable local list merging

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management computer, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want
to configure and click *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration*
and select *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender
Antivirus*.
. Double-click *Configure local administrator merge behavior for lists*
and set the option to *Disabled*. Then select *OK*.

==== Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to disable local list merging

[arabic]
. In the https://endpoint.microsoft.com[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin
center], select *Endpoint security* > *Antivirus*.
. Choose *Create Policy*, or modify an existing Microsoft Defender
Antivirus policy.
. Under the *Configuration settings*, select the drop-down next to
*Disable Local Admin Merge* and select *Disable Local Admin Merge*.

____
[!NOTE] If you disable local list merging, it will override controlled
folder access settings. It also overrides any protected folders or
allowed apps set by the local administrator. For more information about
controlled folder access settings, see
https://support.microsoft.com/help/4046851/windows-10-allow-blocked-app-windows-security[Allow
a blocked app in Windows Security].
