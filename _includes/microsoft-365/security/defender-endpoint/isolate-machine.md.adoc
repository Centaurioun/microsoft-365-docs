=== API description

Isolates a device from accessing external network.

=== Limitations

. Rate limitations for this API are 100 calls per minute and 1500 calls per hour.

[!includexref:../../includes/machineactionsnote.adoc[Device actions note]]

____
[!IMPORTANT]

* Full isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1703, and on Windows 11.
* Selective isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1709 or later, and on Windows 11.
* When isolating a device, only certain processes and destinations are allowed.
Therefore, devices that are behind a full VPN tunnel won't be able to reach the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud service after the device is isolated.
We recommend using a split-tunneling VPN for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud-based protection-related traffic.
____
