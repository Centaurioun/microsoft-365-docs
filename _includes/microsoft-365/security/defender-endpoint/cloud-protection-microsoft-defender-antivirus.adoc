== Cloud protection and Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

Next-generation technologies in Microsoft Defender Antivirus provide
near-instant, automated protection against new and emerging threats. To
identify new threats dynamically, next-generation technologies work with
large sets of interconnected data in the Microsoft Intelligent Security
Graph and powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems driven by
advanced machine learning models. Cloud protection works together with
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to deliver accurate, real-time, and
intelligent protection.

=== How cloud protection works

Microsoft Defender Antivirus works seamlessly with Microsoft cloud
services. These cloud protection services, also referred to as Microsoft
Advanced Protection Service (MAPS), enhance standard real-time
protection. With cloud protection, next-generation technologies provide
rapid identification of new threats, sometimes even before a single
endpoint is infected.

The following blog posts illustrate how cloud protection works:

[!NOTE] The Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud service is a mechanism
for delivering updated protection to your network and endpoints. As a
cloud service, it is not simply protection for files stored in the
cloud; instead, the cloud service uses distributed resources and machine
learning to deliver protection to your endpoints at a rate that is far
faster than traditional security intelligence updates.

=== How to get cloud protection

Cloud protection is enabled by default. However, you might need to
re-enable it if it has been disabled as part of previous organizational
policies. To learn more, see
link:enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Turn on
cloud protection].

If your subscription includes Windows 10 E5, you can take advantage of
emergency dynamic intelligence updates, which provide near real-time
protection from emerging threats. When you turn on cloud protection,
fixes for malware issues can be delivered via the cloud within minutes,
instead of waiting for the next update. See
link:manage-event-based-updates-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md#cloud-report-updates[Configure
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to automatically receive new protection
updates based on reports from our cloud service].
