operating system. This support provides advanced attack detection and
investigation capabilities seamlessly through the Microsoft 365 Defender
console. Support for Windows Server provides deeper insight into server
activities, coverage for kernel and memory attack detection, and enables
response actions.

This article describes how to onboard specific Windows servers to
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

For guidance on how to download and use Windows Security Baselines for
Windows servers, see
link:/windows/device-security/windows-security-baselines[Windows
Security Baselines].

=== Windows Server onboarding overview

You’ll need to complete the following general steps to successfully
onboard servers.

[!NOTE] Windows Hyper-V Server editions are not supported.
____

*Integration with Microsoft Defender for Servers*:

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integrates seamlessly with Microsoft
Defender for Servers. You can onboard servers automatically, have
servers monitored by Microsoft Defender for Cloud appear in Defender for
Endpoint, and conduct detailed investigations as a Microsoft Defender
for Cloud customer. For more information please go to
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint?tabs=windows[Protect
your endpoints with Defender for Cloud’s integrated EDR solution:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint]

____
[!NOTE] For Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016, you can either manually
install/upgrade the modern, unified solution on these machines, or use
the integration to automatically deploy or upgrade servers covered by
your respective Microsoft Defender for Server plan. More information
about making the switch at
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint?tabs=windows#enable-the-integration[Protect
your endpoints with Defender for Cloud’s integrated EDR solution:
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint]. - When you use Microsoft Defender for
Cloud to monitor servers, a Defender for Endpoint tenant is
automatically created (in the US for US users, in the EU for European
users, and in the UK for UK users). Data collected by Defender for
Endpoint is stored in the geo-location of the tenant as identified
during provisioning. - If you use Defender for Endpoint before using
Microsoft Defender for Cloud, your data will be stored in the location
you specified when you created your tenant even if you integrate with
Microsoft Defender for Cloud at a later time. - Once configured, you
cannot change the location where your data is stored. If you need to
move your data to another location, you need to contact Microsoft
Support to reset the tenant. - Server endpoint monitoring utilizing this
integration has been disabled for Office 365 GCC customers. -
Previously, the use of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) on Windows
Server 2016 and previous versions of Windows Server allowed for the OMS
/ Log Analytics gateway to provide connectivity to Defender cloud
services. The new solution, like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on
Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and Windows 10, doesn’t
support this gateway. - Linux servers onboarded through Microsoft
Defender for Cloud will have their initial configuration set to run
Defender Antivirus in
link:/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility#microsoft-defender-antivirus-and-non-microsoft-antivirusantimalware-solutions[passive
mode].

=== Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016

==== New Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 functionality in the modern unified solution

The previous implementation (before April of 2022) of onboarding Windows
Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 required the use of Microsoft
Monitoring Agent (MMA).

The new unified solution package makes it easier to onboard servers by
removing dependencies and installation steps. It also provides a much
expanded feature set. For more information, please refer to
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/defending-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016/ba-p/2783292[Defending
Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016].

Depending on the server that you’re onboarding, the unified solution
installs Microsoft Defender Antivirus and/or the EDR sensor. The
following table indicates what component is installed and what is built
in by default.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]

packages from the portal.

____
[!NOTE] The installation package is updated monthly. Be sure to download
the latest package before usage. To update after installation, you do
not have to run the installer package again. If you do, the installer
will ask you to offboard first as that is a requirement for
uninstallation. See
link:#update-packages-for-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-on-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016[Update
packages for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server 2012 R2

____

____
[!NOTE] On Windows Server 2012R2, Microsoft Defender Antivirus will get
installed by the installation package and will be active unless you set
it to passive mode. On Windows Server 2016, Microsoft Defender Antivirus
must be installed as a feature (see
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/switch-to-mde-phase-2#re-enable-microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016[Switch
to MDE]) first and fully updated before proceeding with the
installation.

If you are running a non-Microsoft anti-malware solution ensure you add
exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus
(https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/b/f/6bfff670-47c3-4e45-b01b-64a2610eaefa/mde-urls-commercial.xlsx[from
this list of Microsoft Defender Processes on the Defender Processes
tab]) to the non-Microsoft solution before installation. It is also
recommended to add non-Microsoft security solutions to the Defender
Antivirus exclusion list.
____

The *installation package* contains an MSI file that installs the
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent.

The *onboarding package* contains the following files:

* `OptionalParamsPolicy` - contains the setting that enables sample
collection
* `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingScript.cmd` - contains the onboarding
script

Follow these steps to download the packages:

[arabic]
. In Microsoft 365 Defender, go to *Settings > Device Management >
Onboarding*.
. Select *Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016*.
. Select *Download installation package* and save the .msi file.
. Select *Download onboarding package* and save the .zip file.
. Install the installation package using any of the options to install
Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The installation requires administrative
permissions.

____
{empty}[!IMPORTANT]

* A local onboarding script is suitable for a proof of concept but
should not be used for production deployment. For a production
deployment, we recommend using Group Policy, or Microsoft Endpoint
Configuration Manager.
____

==== STEP 2: Apply the installation and onboarding package

In this step, you’ll install the prevention and detection components
required before onboarding your device to the Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint cloud environment, to prepare the machine for onboarding.
Ensure all link:#prerequisites[prerequisites] have been met.

____
[!NOTE] Microsoft Defender Antivirus will get installed and will be
active unless you set it to passive mode.
____

===== Options to install the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint packages

In the previous section, you downloaded an installation package. The
installation package contains the installer for all Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint components.

You can use any of the following options to install the agent:

* link:#install-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-using-the-command-line[Install
using the command line]
* link:#install-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-using-a-script[Install
using a script]
* link:#apply-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-installation-and-onboarding-packages-using-group-policy[Apply
the installation and onboarding packages using Group Policy]

====== Install Microsoft Defender For Endpoint using the command line

Use the installation package from the previous step to install Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint.

Run the following command to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:

[source,console]
----
Msiexec /i md4ws.msi /quiet
----

To uninstall, ensure the machine is offboarded first using the
appropriate offboarding script. Then, use Control Panel > Programs >
Programs and Features to perform the uninstall.

Alternatively, run the following uninstall command to uninstall
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:

[source,console]
----
Msiexec /x md4ws.msi /quiet
----

You must use the same package you used for installation for the above
command to succeed.

The `/quiet` switch suppresses all notifications.

____
[!NOTE] Microsoft Defender Antivirus doesn’t automatically go into
passive mode. You can choose to set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to run
in passive mode if you are running a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware
solution. For command line installations, the optional
`FORCEPASSIVEMODE=1` immediately sets the Microsoft Defender Antivirus
component to Passive mode to avoid interference. Then, to ensure
Defender Antivirus remains in passive mode after onboarding to support
capabilities like EDR Block, set the ``ForceDefenderPassiveMode''
registry key.
____

Support for Windows Server provides deeper insight into server
activities, coverage for kernel and memory attack detection, and enables
response actions.

====== Install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using a script

You can use the link:server-migration.md#installer-script[installer
helper script] to help automate installation, uninstallation, and
onboarding.

____
[!NOTE] The installation script is signed. Any modifications to the
script will invalidate the signature. When you download the script from
GitHub, the recommended approach to avoid inadvertent modification is to
download the source files as a zip archive then extract it to obtain the
install.ps1 file (on the main Code page, click the Code dropdown menu
and select ``Download ZIP'').
____

This script can be used in various scenarios, including those scenarios
described in
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/server-migration[Server
migration scenarios from the previous&#44; MMA-based Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint solution] and for deployment using Group Policy as described
below.

====== Apply the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation and onboarding packages using Group policy

[arabic]
. Create a group policy: Open the
link:/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/group-policy-and-group-policy-mgmt-console-ie11[Group
Policy Management Console] (GPMC), right-click *Group Policy Objects*
you want to configure and select *New*. Enter the name of the new GPO in
the dialogue box that is displayed and select *OK*.
. Open the
link:/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/group-policy-and-group-policy-mgmt-console-ie11[Group
Policy Management Console] (GPMC), right-click the Group Policy Object
(GPO) you want to configure and select *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor*, go to *Computer
configuration*, then *Preferences*, and then *Control panel settings*.
. Right-click *Scheduled tasks*, point to *New*, and then click
*Immediate Task (At least Windows 7)*.
. In the *Task* window that opens, go to the *General* tab. Under
*Security options* select *Change User or Group* and type SYSTEM and
then select *Check Names* then *OK*. NT AUTHORITYappears as the user
account the task will run as.
. Select *Run whether user is logged on or not* and check the *Run with
highest privileges* check box.
. In the Name field, type an appropriate name for the scheduled task
(for example, Defender for Endpoint Deployment).
. Go to the *Actions* tab and select *New…* Ensure that *Start a
program* is selected in the *Action* field. The
link:server-migration.md#installer-script[installer script] handles the
installation, and immediately perform the onboarding step after
installation completes. Select _C:.0.exe_ then provide the arguments:
+
[source,console]
----
 -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned \\servername-or-dfs-space\share-name\install.ps1 -OnboardingScript \\servername-or-dfs-space\share-name\windowsdefenderatponboardingscript.cmd
----
+
____
[!NOTE] The recommended execution policy setting is `Allsigned`. This
requires importing the script’s signing certificate into the Local
Computer Trusted Publishers store if the script is running as SYSTEM on
the endpoint.
____
+
Replace \-or-dfs-space-name with the UNC path, using the file server’s
fully qualified domain name (FQDN), of the shared _install.ps1_ file.
The installer package md4ws.msi must be placed in the same directory.
Ensure that the permissions of the UNC path allow write access to the
computer account that is installing the package, to support creation of
log files. If you wish to disable the creation of log files (not
recommended), you can use the -noETL -noMSILog parameters.
+
For scenarios where you want Microsoft Defender Antivirus to co-exist
with non-Microsoft antimalware solutions, add the $Passive parameter to
set passive mode during installation.
. Select *OK* and close any open GPMC windows.
. To link the GPO to an Organization Unit (OU), right-click and select
*Link an existing GPO*. In the dialogue box that is displayed, select
the Group Policy Object that you wish to link. Select *OK*.

For more configuration settings, see
link:configure-endpoints-gp.md#configure-sample-collection-settings[Configure
sample collection settings] and
link:configure-endpoints-gp.md#other-recommended-configuration-settings[Other
recommended configuration settings].

==== STEP 3: Complete the onboarding steps

The following steps are only applicable if you’re using a third-party
anti-malware solution. You’ll need to apply the following Microsoft
Defender Antivirus passive mode setting. Verify that it was configured
correctly:

[arabic]
. Set the following registry entry:
* Path:
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`
* Name: `ForceDefenderPassiveMode`
* Type: `REG_DWORD`
* Value: `1`

lightbox=``images/atp-verify-passive-mode.png'':::

===== Known issues and limitations in the new, unified solution package for Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016

____
{empty}[!IMPORTANT]

* Always download the latest installer package from the Microsoft 365
Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com) before performing a new
installation and ensure prerequisites have been met. After installation,
ensure to regularly update using component updates described in the
section
link:#update-packages-for-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-on-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016[Update
packages for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server 2012 R2
and 2016].
____

* An operating system update can introduce an installation issue on
machines with slower disks due to a timeout with service installation.
Installation fails with the message ``Could not find
c:filesdefender.dll, - 310 WinDefend''. Use the latest installation
package, and the latest
https://github.com/microsoft/mdefordownlevelserver[install.ps1] script
to help clear the failed installation if necessary.
* We’ve identified an issue with Windows Server 2012 R2 connectivity to
cloud when static TelemetryProxyServer is used *and* the certificate
revocation list (CRL) URLs aren’t reachable from the SYSTEM account
context. Ensure the EDR sensor is updated to version 10.8210.* or later
(using
https://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-update-for-edr-sensor-f8f69773-f17f-420f-91f4-a8e5167284ac[KB5005292])
to resolve the issue. Alternatively, use a different proxy option
(``system-wide'') that provides such connectivity, or configure the same
proxy via the WinInet setting on the SYSTEM account context.
* On Windows Server 2012 R2, there’s no user interface for Microsoft
Defender Antivirus. In addition, the user interface on Windows Server
2016 only allows for basic operations. To perform operations on a device
locally, refer to
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-mde-post-migration-other-tools[Manage
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with PowerShell&#44; WMI&#44; and MPCmdRun.exe].
As a result, features that specifically rely on user interaction, such
as where the user is prompted to make a decision or perform a specific
task, may not work as expected. It’s recommended to disable or not
enable the user interface nor require user interaction on any managed
server as it may impact protection capability.
* Not all Attack Surface Reduction rules are applicable to all operating
systems. See
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules[Attack
Surface Reduction (ASR) rules].
* Operating system upgrades aren’t supported. Offboard then uninstall
before upgrading. The installer package can only be used to upgrade
installations that have not yet been updated with new antimalware
platform or EDR sensor update packages.
* Automatic exclusions for *server roles* aren’t supported on Windows
Server 2012 R2; however, built-in exclusions for operating system files
are. For more information about adding exclusions, see
https://support.microsoft.com/topic/virus-scanning-recommendations-for-enterprise-computers-that-are-running-currently-supported-versions-of-windows-kb822158-c067a732-f24a-9079-d240-3733e39b40bc[Virus
scanning recommendations for Enterprise computers that are running
currently supported versions of Windows].
* To automatically deploy and onboard the new solution using Microsoft
Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) you need to be on
link:/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2207#improved-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-mde-onboarding-for-windows-server-2012-r2-and-windows-server-2016[version
2207 or later]. You can still configure and deploy using version 2107
with the hotfix rollup, but this requires additional deployment steps.
See
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/server-migration#microsoft-endpoint-configuration-manager-migration-scenarios[Microsoft
Endpoint Configuration Manager migration scenarios] for more
information.
