This article provides troubleshooting information for security
administrators who are experiencing issues when switching from a
non-Microsoft endpoint protection solution to Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint.

=== Microsoft Defender Antivirus is getting uninstalled on Windows Server

When you make the switch to Defender for Endpoint, you begin with your
non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware protection in active mode. As part
of the setup process, you configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus in
passive mode. Occasionally, your non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware
solution might prevent Microsoft Defender Antivirus from running on
Windows Server. In fact, it can look like Microsoft Defender Antivirus
has been removed from Windows Server.

To resolve this issue, take the following steps:

. link:#add-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-to-the-exclusion-list[Add
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to the exclusion list].
. link:#set-microsoft-defender-antivirus-to-passive-mode-manually[Set
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode manually].

==== Add Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to the exclusion list

Certain exclusions for Defender for Endpoint must be defined in your
existing non-Microsoft endpoint protection solution. Make sure to add
the following exclusions:

`C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\MsSense.exe`

`C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\SenseCncProxy.exe`

`C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\SenseSampleUploader.exe`

`C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\SenseIR.exe`

`C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\SenseCM.exe`

==== Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode manually

On Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, Windows
Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2, you must set Microsoft Defender
Antivirus to passive mode manually. This action helps prevent problems
caused by having multiple antivirus products installed on a server. You
can set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode using PowerShell,
Group Policy, or a registry key.

You can set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode by setting the
following registry key:

Path:
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`

Name: `ForceDefenderPassiveMode`

Type: `REG_DWORD`

Value: `1`

____
[!NOTE] For passive mode to work on endpoints running Windows Server
2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2, those endpoints must be onboarded using
the instructions in
link:configure-server-endpoints.md#windows-server-2012-r2-and-windows-server-2016[Onboard
Windows servers].
____

Antivirus in Windows].

=== Microsoft Defender Antivirus seems to be stuck in passive mode

If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is stuck in passive mode, set it to
active mode manually by following these steps:

[arabic]
. On your Windows device, open Registry Editor as an administrator.
. Go to
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.
. Set or define a *REG_DWORD* entry called `ForceDefenderPassiveMode`,
and set its value to `0`.
. Reboot the device.

Antivirus to active mode after following this procedure,

=== I am having trouble re-enabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2016

If you are using a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware solution on
Windows Server 2016, your existing solution might have required
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be disabled or uninstalled. You can use
thelink:command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Malware
Protection Command-Line Utility] to re-enable Microsoft Defender
Antivirus on Windows Server 2016.

[arabic]
. As a local administrator on the server, open Command Prompt.
. Run the following command: `MpCmdRun.exe -wdenable`
. Restart the device.
