== Review remediation actions following an automated investigation

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2]
* xref:../defender-business/mdb-overview.adoc[Microsoft Defender for Business]

=== Remediation actions

When an xref:automated-investigations.adoc[automated investigation] runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated.
Verdicts can be _Malicious_, _Suspicious_, or _No threats found_.

Depending on

* the type of threat,
* the resulting verdict, and
* how your organization's link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups[device groups] are configured,

remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by your organization's security operations team.

____
[!NOTE] Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
____

Here are a few examples:

* *Example 1*: Fabrikam's device groups are set to *Full - remediate threats automatically* (the recommended setting).
In this case, remediation actions are taken automatically for artifacts that are considered to be malicious following an automated investigation (see <<review-completed-actions,Review completed actions>>).
* *Example 2*: Contoso's devices are included in a device group that is set for *Semi - require approval for any remediation*.
In this case, Contoso's security operations team must review and approve all remediation actions following an automated investigation (see <<review-pending-actions,Review pending actions>>).
* *Example 3*: Tailspin Toys has their device groups set to *No automated response* (not recommended).
In this case, automated investigations do not occur.
No remediation actions are taken or pending, and no actions are logged in the link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center#the-action-center[Action center] for their devices (see link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups#manage-device-groups[Manage device groups]).

Whether taken automatically or upon approval, an automated investigation can result in one or more of the remediation actions:

* Quarantine a file
* Remove a registry key
* Kill a process
* Stop a service
* Disable a driver
* Remove a scheduled task

=== Review pending actions

. Go to the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender portal] and sign in.
. In the navigation pane, choose *Action center*.
. Review the items on the *Pending* tab.
. Select an action to open its flyout pane.
. In the flyout pane, review the information, and then take one of the following steps:
 ** Select *Open investigation page* to view more details about the investigation.
 ** Select *Approve* to initiate a pending action.
 ** Select *Reject* to prevent a pending action from being taken.
 ** Select *Go hunt* to go into xref:advanced-hunting-overview.adoc[Advanced hunting].

=== Review completed actions

. In the navigation pane, choose *Action center*.
. Review the items on the *History* tab.
. Select an item to view more details about that remediation action.

=== Undo completed actions

If you've determined that a device or a file is not a threat, you can undo remediation actions that were taken, whether those actions were taken automatically or manually.
In the Action center, on the *History* tab, you can undo any of the following actions:

|===

=== Automation levels, automated investigation results, and resulting actions

Automation levels affect whether certain remediation actions are taken automatically or only upon approval.
Sometimes your security operations team has more steps to take, depending on the results of an automated investigation.
The following table summarizes automation levels, results of automated investigations, and what to do in each case.

|===
| Device group setting | Automated investigation results | What to do

| *Full - remediate threats automatically* + (recommended)
| A verdict of _Malicious_ is reached for a piece of evidence.
<p> Appropriate remediation actions are taken automatically.
| <<review-completed-actions,Review completed actions>>

| *Semi - require approval for any remediation*
| A verdict of either _Malicious_ or _Suspicious_ is reached for a piece of evidence.
<p> Remediation actions are pending approval to proceed.
| <<review-pending-actions,Approve (or reject) pending actions>>

| *Semi - require approval for core folders remediation*
| A verdict of _Malicious_ is reached for a piece of evidence.
<p> If the artifact is a file or executable and is in an operating system directory, such as the Windows folder or the Program files folder, then remediation actions are pending approval.
<p> If the artifact is _not_ in an operating system directory, remediation actions are taken automatically.
| <ol><li><<review-pending-actions,Approve (or reject) pending actions>></li><li><<review-completed-actions,Review completed actions>></li></ol>

<p> If the artifact is a file or executable that _is_ in a temporary folder, remediation actions are taken automatically.
| <ol><li><<review-pending-actions,Approve (or reject) pending actions>></li><li><<review-completed-actions,Review completed actions>></li></ol>

| *Semi - require approval for non-temp folders remediation*

| Any of the *Full* or *Semi* automation levels
| A verdict of _No threats found_ is reached for a piece of evidence.
<p> No remediation actions are taken, and no actions are pending approval.
| link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center[View details and results of automated investigations]

| *No automated response* (not recommended)
| No automated investigations run, so no verdicts are reached, and no remediation actions are taken or awaiting approval.
| link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups[Consider setting up or changing your device groups to use *Full* or *Semi* automation]

All verdicts are tracked in the link:auto-investigation-action-center.md#the-unified-action-center[Action center].

____
[!NOTE] In xref:../defender-business/mdb-overview.adoc[Defender for Business], automated investigation and remediation capabilities are preset to use *Full - remediate threats automatically*.
These capabilities are applied to all devices by default.
