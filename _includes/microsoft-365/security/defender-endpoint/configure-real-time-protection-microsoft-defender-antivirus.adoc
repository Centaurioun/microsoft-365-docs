monitoring, and heuristics to identify malware based on known suspicious
and malicious activities.

These activities include events, such as processes making unusual
changes to existing files, modifying or creating automatic startup
registry keys and startup locations (also known as autostart
extensibility points, or ASEPs), and other changes to the file system or
file structure.
