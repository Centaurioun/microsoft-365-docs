____
[!IMPORTANT] On March 31, 2020, the Microsoft Defender Antivirus reporting feature of Update Compliance will be removed.
You can continue to define and review security compliance policies using https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-endpoint-manager[Microsoft Endpoint Manager], which allows finer control over security features and updates.
____

You can use Microsoft Defender Antivirus with Update Compliance.
You'll see status for E3, B, F1, VL, and Pro licenses.
However, for E5 licenses, you need to use the link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-endpoints[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal].
To learn more about licensing options, see https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/windows10.aspx[Windows 10 product licensing options].

When you use link:/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-using#wdav-assessment[Windows Analytics Update Compliance to obtain reporting into the protection status of devices or endpoints] in your network that are using Microsoft Defender Antivirus, you might encounter problems or issues.

Typically, the most common indicators of a problem are:

* You only see a small number or subset of all the devices you were expecting to see
* You do not see any devices at all
* The reports and information you do see is outdated (older than a few days)

For common error codes and event IDs related to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus service that are not related to Update Compliance, see xref:troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Microsoft Defender Antivirus events].

There are three steps to troubleshooting these problems:

. Confirm that you have met all prerequisites
. Check your connectivity to the Windows Defender cloud-based service
. Submit support logs

____
[!IMPORTANT] It typically takes 3 days for devices to start appearing in Update Compliance.
____

=== Confirm prerequisites

In order for devices to properly show up in Update Compliance, you have to meet certain prerequisites for both the Update Compliance service and for Microsoft Defender Antivirus:

____
[!div class="checklist"]

* Endpoints are using Microsoft Defender Antivirus as the sole antivirus protection app.
xref:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.adoc[Using any other antivirus app will cause Microsoft Defender Antivirus to disable itself] and the endpoint will not be reported in Update Compliance.
* xref:enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Cloud-delivered protection is enabled].
* Endpoints can link:configure-network-connections-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md#validate-connections-between-your-network-and-the-cloud[connect to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud]
* If the endpoint is running Windows 10 version 1607 or earlier, link:/windows/configuration/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#enhanced-level[Windows 10 diagnostic data must be set to the Enhanced level].
* It has been 3 days since all requirements have been met
