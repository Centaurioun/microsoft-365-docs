== Configure and run on-demand Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans

*Applies to:* -
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint Plan 1] -

Endpoint Plan 2] - Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

You can run an on-demand scan on individual endpoints. These scans will
start immediately, and you can define parameters for the scan, such as
the location or type. When you run a scan, you can choose from among
three types: Quick scan, full scan, and custom scan. In most cases, use
a quick scan. A quick scan looks at all the locations where there could
be malware registered to start with the system, such as registry keys
and known Windows startup folders.

Combined with always-on, real-time protection, which reviews files when
they are opened and closed, and whenever a user navigates to a folder, a
quick scan helps provide strong protection against malware that starts
with the system and kernel-level malware. In most cases, a quick scan is
sufficient and is the recommended option for scheduled or on-demand
scans.

[!IMPORTANT] Microsoft Defender Antivirus runs in the context of the
link:/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account[LocalSystem] account
when performing a local scan. For network scans, it uses the context of
the device account. If the domain device account doesn’t have
appropriate permissions to access the share, the scan won’t work. Ensure
that the device has permissions to the access network share.
