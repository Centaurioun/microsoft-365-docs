=== Limitations

[arabic]
. Rate limitations for this API are 100 calls per minute and 1500 calls
per hour.

{empty}[!includelink:../../includes/machineactionsnote.md[Device actions
note]]

____
{empty}[!IMPORTANT]

* Full isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version 1703,
and on Windows 11.
* Selective isolation is available for devices on Windows 10, version
1709 or later, and on Windows 11.
* When isolating a device, only certain processes and destinations are
allowed. Therefore, devices that are behind a full VPN tunnel wonâ€™t be
able to reach the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud service after
the device is isolated. We recommend using a split-tunneling VPN for
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus
cloud-based protection-related traffic.
____
