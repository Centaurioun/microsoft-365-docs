== Turn on definition retirement

[!INCLUDE xref:../../includes/microsoft-defender.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding]]

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2]

You can configure definition retirement using Group Policy.
Definition retirement checks to see if a computer has the required security updates necessary to protect it against a particular vulnerability.
If the system is not vulnerable to the exploit detected by a definition, then that definition is "retired".
If all security intelligence for a given protocol are retired then that protocol is no longer parsed.
Enabling this feature helps to improve performance.
On a computer that is up-to-date with all the latest security updates, network protection will have no impact on network performance.

. On your Group Policy management endpoint, open the link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group Policy Management Console].
