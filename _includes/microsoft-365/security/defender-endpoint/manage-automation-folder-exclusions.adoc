Automated investigation will skip.

You can control the following attributes about the folder that youâ€™d
like to be skipped:

____
[!NOTE] At this time, use of wild cards as a way to exclude files under
a directory is not yet supported.

* *Extensions of the files*: You can specify the extensions to exclude
in a specific directory. The extensions are a way to prevent an attacker
from using an excluded folder to hide an exploit. The extensions
explicitly define which files to ignore.
* *File names*: You can specify the file names that you want to be
excluded in a specific directory. The names are a way to prevent an
attacker from using an excluded folder to hide an exploit. The names
explicitly define which files to ignore.
