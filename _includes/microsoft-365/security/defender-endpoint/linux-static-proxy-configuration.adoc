Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can discover a proxy server using the
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable. This setting must be configured
*both* at installation time and after the product has been installed.

=== Installation time configuration

During installation, the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable must be
passed to the package manager. The package manager can read this
variable in any of the following ways:

* The `HTTPS_PROXY` variable is defined in `/etc/environment` with the
following line:
+
[source,bash]
----
HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.server:port/"
----
* The `HTTPS_PROXY` variable is defined in the package manager global
configuration. For example, in Ubuntu 18.04, you can add the following
line to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf`:
+
[source,bash]
----
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://proxy.server:port/";
----
+
____
[!CAUTION] Note that above two methods could define the proxy to use for
other applications on your system. Use this method with caution, or only
if this is meant to be a generally global configuration.
____
* The `HTTPS_PROXY` variable is prepended to the installation or
uninstallation commands. For example, with the APT package manager,
prepend the variable as follows when installing Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint:
+
[source,bash]
----
HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.server:port/" apt install mdatp
----
+
____
[!NOTE] Do not add sudo between the environment variable definition and
apt, otherwise the variable will not be propagated.
____

The `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable may similarly be defined during
uninstallation.

Note that installation and uninstallation will not necessarily fail if a
proxy is required but not configured. However, telemetry will not be
submitted, and the operation could take much longer due to network
timeouts.

=== Post installation configuration

After installation, configure Defender for Endpoint with static proxy
using one of the following methods:

[source,bash]
----
mdatp config proxy set --value http://address:port
----

____
[!NOTE] This method works for every distribution of Defender for
Endpoint on Linux and is *Recommended*.
____

The `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable must be defined in the Defender
for Endpoint service file. To do this, run
`sudo systemctl edit --full mdatp.service`. You can then propagate the
variable to the service in one of two ways:

* Uncomment the line `#Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://address:port"`
and specify your static proxy address.
* Add a line `EnvironmentFile=/path/to/env/file`. This path can point to
`/etc/environment` or a custom file, either of which needs to add the
following line:
+
[source,bash]
----
HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.server:port/"
----

After modifying `mdatp.service`, save the file and restart the service
so the changes can be applied using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload; sudo systemctl restart mdatp
----

____
[!NOTE] To remove any additions you might have made before uninstalling
`mdatp`, delete the custom file from `/etc/systemd/system`.
____

____
[!NOTE] Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.X and CentOS 6.X donâ€™t support
*systemctl* and */etc/environment* methods. To configure static proxy
for MDE on these distributions, use the Recommended *mdatp config proxy
set* method.
