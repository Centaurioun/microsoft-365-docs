*Welcome to the Prepare phase of
link:switch-to-mde-overview.md#the-migration-process[switching to
Defender for Endpoint]*.

This migration phase includes the following steps:

[arabic]
. link:#get-and-deploy-updates-across-your-organizations-devices[Get and
deploy updates across your organization’s devices].
. link:#get-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-plan-1-or-plan-2[Get
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or Plan 2].
. link:#grant-access-to-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal[Grant access
to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
. link:#more-information-about-device-proxy-and-internet-connectivity-settings[Review
more information about device proxy and internet connectivity settings].

=== Get and deploy updates across your organization’s devices

As a best practice, keep your organization’s devices and endpoints up to
date. Make sure your existing endpoint protection and antivirus solution
is up to date, and that your organization’s operating systems and apps
also have the latest updates. Getting updates installed now can help
prevent problems later as you migrate to Defender for Endpoint and
employ Microsoft Defender Antivirus on all your devices.

==== Make sure your existing solution is up to date

Keep your existing endpoint protection solution up to date, and make
sure that your organization’s devices have the latest security updates.
Make sure to review your solution provider’s documentation for updates.

==== Make sure your organization’s devices are up to date

=== Get Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or Plan 2

Now that you’ve updated your organization’s devices, the next step is to
get Defender for Endpoint, assign licenses, and make sure the service is
provisioned.

[arabic]
. Buy or try Defender for Endpoint today. https://aka.ms/mdatp[Start a
free trial or request a quote]. Note that Microsoft 365 E3 includes
Defender for Endpoint Plan 1, and Microsoft 365 E5 includes Defender for
Endpoint Plan 2.
. Verify that your licenses are properly provisioned.
link:production-deployment.md#check-license-state[Check your license
state].
. Set up your dedicated cloud instance of Defender for Endpoint. See
link:production-deployment.md#tenant-configuration[Defender for Endpoint
setup: Tenant configuration].
. If any devices in your organization use a proxy to access the
internet, follow the guidance in
link:production-deployment.md#network-configuration[Defender for
Endpoint setup: Network configuration].

At this point, you’re ready to grant access to your security
administrators and security operators who will use the Microsoft 365
Defender portal.

____
[!TIP] The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is accessed at
https://security.microsoft.com. The former Microsoft Defender Security
Center (https://securitycenter.windows.com) now redirects to the
Microsoft 365 Defender portal. To learn more, see
link:portal-overview.md[Microsoft 365 Defender portal overview].
____

=== Grant access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is where you and your security team
will access and configure features and capabilities of Defender for
Endpoint. To learn more, see link:use.md[Overview of the Microsoft 365
Defender portal].

Permissions to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal can be granted by using
either basic permissions or role-based access control (RBAC). We
recommend using RBAC so that you have more granular control over
permissions.

[arabic]
. Plan the roles and permissions for your security administrators and
security operators. See
link:prepare-deployment.md#role-based-access-control[Role-based access
control].
. Set up and configure RBAC. We recommend using
link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune[Intune] to configure RBAC,
especially if your organization is using a combination of Windows,
macOS, iOS, and Android devices. See
link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control[setting up RBAC
using Intune].
+
If your organization requires a method other than Intune, choose one of
the following options:
* link:/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/configure-role-based-administration[Configuration
Manager]
* link:/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/agpm[Advanced Group Policy
Management]
* link:/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview[Windows
Admin Center]
. Grant your security team access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
(Need help? See link:rbac.md[Manage portal access using RBAC].

=== More information about device proxy and internet connectivity settings

To enable communication between your devices and Defender for Endpoint,
you might have to configure proxy and internet settings. The following
table includes links to resources you can use to configure your proxy
and internet settings for various operating systems:

* Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2 require installation of
the modern, unified solution for Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016. For
more information, see

____
[!IMPORTANT] The standalone versions of Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and
Plan 2 do not include server licenses. To onboard servers, you’ll need
an additional license, such as
