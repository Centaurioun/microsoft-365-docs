== Manage tamper protection on an individual device

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2]

*Platforms*

* Windows

____
[!NOTE] Tamper protection blocks attempts to modify Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings through the registry.
To help ensure that tamper protection doesn't interfere with non-Microsoft security products or enterprise installation scripts that modify these settings, go to *Windows Security* and update *Security intelligence* to version 1.287.60.0 or later.
(See https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/definitions[Security intelligence updates].) After you've made this update, tamper protection continues to protect your registry settings, and logs attempts to modify them without returning errors.
____

If you're a home user, or you aren't subject to settings managed by a security team, you can use the Windows Security app to manage tamper protection.
You must have appropriate admin permissions on your device to do change security settings, such as tamper protection.

Here's what you see in the Windows Security app:
