== Prevent or allow users to locally modify Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy settings

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms*

* Windows

By default, Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings that are deployed via a Group Policy Object to the endpoints in your network will prevent users from locally changing the settings.
You can change this configuration in some instances.
For example, it might be necessary to allow certain user groups, such as security researchers and threat investigators, to have further control over individual settings on the endpoints they use.

=== Configure local overrides for Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings

The default setting for these local override policies is *Disabled*.

If the policies are set to *Enabled*, users can make changes to the associated settings on their devices by using the xref:microsoft-defender-security-center-antivirus.adoc[Windows Security] app, local Group Policy settings, or PowerShell cmdlets (where appropriate).

The <<table-of-settings,table of settings section>> lists override policy settings and the configuration instructions.

To configure these settings:

. On your Group Policy management computer, open the link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and then select *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration* and select *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* and then the *Location* specified in the <<table-of-settings,table of settings section>> (in this article).
. Double-click the policy *Setting* as specified in the table below, and set the option to your desired configuration.
Select *OK*, and repeat for any other settings.
. Deploy the Group Policy Object as usual.

=== Configure how locally and globally defined threat remediation and exclusions lists are merged

You can also configure how locally defined lists are combined or merged with globally defined lists.
This setting applies to xref:configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[exclusion lists], xref:configure-remediation-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[specified remediation lists], and link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction[attack surface reduction].

By default, lists that have been configured in local group policy and the Windows Security app are merged with lists that are defined by the appropriate Group Policy Object that you have deployed on your network.
Where there are conflicts, the globally defined list takes precedence.
You can disable this setting to ensure that only globally-defined lists (such as those from any deployed GPOs) are used.

==== Use Group Policy to disable local list merging

. On your Group Policy management computer, open the link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration* and select *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus*.
. Double-click *Configure local administrator merge behavior for lists* and set the option to *Disabled*.
Then select *OK*.

==== Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to disable local list merging

. In the https://endpoint.microsoft.com[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center], select *Endpoint security* > *Antivirus*.
. Choose *Create Policy*, or modify an existing Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy.
. Under the *Configuration settings*, select the drop-down next to *Disable Local Admin Merge* and select *Disable Local Admin Merge*.

____
[!NOTE] If you disable local list merging, it will override controlled folder access settings.
It also overrides any protected folders or allowed apps set by the local administrator.
For more information about controlled folder access settings, see https://support.microsoft.com/help/4046851/windows-10-allow-blocked-app-windows-security[Allow a blocked app in Windows Security].
