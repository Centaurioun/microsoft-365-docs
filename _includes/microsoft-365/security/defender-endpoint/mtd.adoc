Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android and iOS is our *mobile threat
defense solution (MTD)*. Typically, companies are proactive in
protecting PCs from vulnerabilities and attack while mobile devices
often go unmonitored and unprotected. Where mobile platforms have
built-in protection such as app isolation and vetted consumer app
stores, these platforms remain vulnerable to web-based or other
sophisticated attacks. As more employees use devices for work and to
access sensitive information, it is imperative that companies deploy an
MTD solution to protect devices and your resources from increasingly
sophisticated attacks on mobiles.

to deploy the service to a larger set of devices. You can define the
exit criteria and ensure that they are satisfied before deploying
widely.

This helps reduce potential issues that could arise while rolling out
the service. Here are some tests and exit criteria that might help:

* Devices show up in the device inventory list: After successful
onboarding of Defender for Endpoint on the mobile device, verify that
the device is listed in the Device Inventory in the
https://security.microsoft.com[security console].
* Run a malware detection test on an Android device: Install any test
virus app from the Google play store and verify that it gets detected by
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Here is an example app that can be used
for this test:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antivirus&hl=en_US&gl=US[Test
virus]. Note that on Android Enterprise with a work profile, only the
work profile is supported.
* Run a phishing test: Browse to https://smartscreentestratings2.net and
verify that it gets blocked by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Note
that on Android Enterprise with a work profile, only the work profile is
supported.
