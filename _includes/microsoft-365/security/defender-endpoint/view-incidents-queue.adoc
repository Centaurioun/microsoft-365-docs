The *Incidents queue* shows a collection of incidents that were flagged
from devices in your network. It helps you sort through incidents to
prioritize and create an informed cybersecurity response decision.

By default, the queue displays incidents seen in the last 30 days, with
the most recent incident showing at the top of the list, helping you see
the most recent incidents first.

There are several options you can choose from to customize the Incidents
queue view.

On the top navigation you can: - Customize columns to add or remove
columns - Modify the number of items to view per page - Select the items
to show per page - Batch-select the incidents to assign - Navigate
between pages - Apply filters - Customize and apply date ranges

=== Sort and filter the incidents queue

You can apply the following filters to limit the list of incidents and
get a more focused view.

==== Severity

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",options="header",]
|===
|Incident severity |Description
|High (Red) |Threats often associated with advanced persistent threats
(APT). These incidents indicate a high risk due to the severity of
damage they can inflict on devices.

|Medium (Orange) |Threats rarely observed in the organization, such as
anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and observed
behaviors typical of attack stages.

|Low (Yellow) |Threats associated with prevalent malware and hack-tools
that do not necessarily indicate an advanced threat targeting the
organization.

|Informational (Grey) |Informational incidents might not be considered
harmful to the network but might be good to keep track of.
|===

=== Assigned to

You can choose to filter the list by selecting assigned to anyone or
ones that are assigned to you.

==== Category

Incidents are categorized based on the description of the stage by which
the cybersecurity kill chain is in. This view helps the threat analyst
to determine priority, urgency, and corresponding response strategy to
deploy based on context.

==== Status

You can choose to limit the list of incidents shown based on their
status to see which ones are active or resolved.

==== Data sensitivity

Use this filter to show incidents that contain sensitivity labels.

=== Incident naming

To understand the incidentâ€™s scope at a glance, incident names are
automatically generated based on alert attributes such as the number of
endpoints affected, users affected, detection sources or categories.

For example: _Multi-stage incident on multiple endpoints reported by
multiple sources._

____
[!NOTE] Incidents that existed prior the rollout of automatic incident
naming will retain their name.
