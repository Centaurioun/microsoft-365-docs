____

Defender for Endpoint can discover a proxy server by using the following
discovery methods:

* Transparent proxy
* Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that
anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs. For
transparent proxies, no additional configuration is needed for Defender
for Endpoint. For static proxy, follow the steps in
link:linux-static-proxy-configuration.md[Manual Static Proxy
Configuration].

____
[!WARNING] PAC, WPAD, and authenticated proxies are not supported.
Ensure that only a static proxy or transparent proxy is being used.

SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are also not supported for
security reasons. Configure an exception for SSL inspection and your
proxy server to directly pass through data from Defender for Endpoint on
Linux to the relevant URLs without interception. Adding your
interception certificate to the global store will not allow for
interception.
