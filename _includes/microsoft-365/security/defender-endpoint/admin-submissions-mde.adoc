In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, admins can use the unified
submissions feature to submit files and file hashes (SHAs) to Microsoft
for review. The unified submissions experience is a one-stop shop for
submitting emails, URLs, email attachments, and files in one,
easy-to-use submission experience. Admins can use the Microsoft 365
Defender portal or the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Alert page to
submit suspicious files.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* The new unified submissions experience is available only in
subscriptions that include Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 2, or Microsoft Defender for Office Plan 2.
* To submit files to Microsoft, you need to be a member of one of the
following role groups:
** *Organization Management*, *Security Administrator*, or *Security
Reader* in the
link:../office-365-security/mdo-portal-permissions.md[Microsoft 365
Defender portal].
* For more information about how you can submit spam, phish, URLs, and
email attachments to Microsoft, see
link:../office-365-security/submissions-report-messages-files-to-microsoft.md[Report
messages and files to Microsoft].

=== Report items to Microsoft from the portal

If you have a file that you suspect might be malware or is being
incorrectly detected (false positive), you can submit it to Microsoft

https://security.microsoft.com/.
