The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent depends on Microsoft Defender Antivirus for some capabilities such as file scanning.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Defender for Endpoint does not adhere to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus Exclusions settings.
____

You must configure Security intelligence updates on the Defender for Endpoint devices whether Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the active anti-malware or not.
For more information, see xref:manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines].

If an onboarded device is protected by a third-party anti-malware client, Microsoft Defender Antivirus on that endpoint will enter into passive mode.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus will continue to receive updates, and the _mspeng.exe_ process will be listed as a running a service.
But, it won't perform scans and doesn't replace the running third-party anti-malware client.

The Microsoft Defender Antivirus interface will be disabled.
Users on the device won't be able to use Microsoft Defender Antivirus to perform on-demand scans or configure most options.

For more information, see the xref:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.adoc[Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Defender for Endpoint compatibility topic].
