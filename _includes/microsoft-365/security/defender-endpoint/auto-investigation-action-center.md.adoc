== Visit the Action center to see remediation actions

During and after an automated investigation, remediation actions for threat detections are identified.
Depending on the particular threat and how xref:configure-automated-investigations-remediation.adoc[automated investigation and remediation capabilities are configured] for your organization, some remediation actions are taken automatically, and others require approval.
If you're part of your organization's security operations team, you can view pending and completed link:manage-auto-investigation.md#remediation-actions[remediation actions] in the *Action center*.
