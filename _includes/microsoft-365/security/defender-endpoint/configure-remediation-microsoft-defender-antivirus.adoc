== Configure remediation for Microsoft Defender Antivirus detections

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender
for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

When Microsoft Defender Antivirus runs a scan, it attempts to remediate
or remove threats that are detected. You can configure how Microsoft
Defender Antivirus should address certain threats, whether a restore
point should be created before remediating, and when threats should be
removed.

This article describes how to configure these settings by using Group
Policy, but you can also use
link:/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies#threat-overrides-settings[Microsoft
Endpoint Configuration Manager] and
link:/intune/device-restrictions-configure[Microsoft Intune].

You can also use the
link:/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference[`Set-MpPreference`
PowerShell cmdlet] or
link:/previous-versions/windows/desktop/defender/windows-defender-wmiv2-apis-portal[`MSFT_MpPreference`
WMI class] to configure these settings.

=== Configure remediation options

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management computer, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want
to configure and click *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration*

[!IMPORTANT] Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects and remediates files
based on many factors. Sometimes, completing a remediation requires a
reboot. Even if the detection is later determined to be a false
positive, the reboot must be completed to ensure all additional
remediation steps have been completed.

If you are certain Microsoft Defender Antivirus quarantined a file based
on a false positive, you can restore the file from quarantine after the
device reboots. See
link:restore-quarantined-files-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Restore
quarantined files in Microsoft Defender Antivirus].

To avoid this problem in the future, you can exclude files from the
scans. See
link:configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Configure and
validate exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans].
