==== Onboarding methods

Deployment methods vary, depending on operating system and preferred
methods. The following table lists resources to help you onboard to
Defender for Endpoint:

should not be used for production deployment. For a production
deployment, we recommend using Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint

{empty}(1) Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2 will need to
be onboarded using the instructions in
link:configure-server-endpoints.md#windows-server-2012-r2-and-windows-server-2016[Onboard
Windows servers].

=== Run a detection test

To verify that your onboarded devices are properly connected to Defender
for Endpoint, you can run a detection test.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Operating system |Guidance
|Windows 10 or laterWindows Server 2022Windows Server 2019Windows
Server, version 1803, or laterWindows Server 2016Windows Server 2012 R2
|See link:run-detection-test.md[Run a detection test].

|macOS (see link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md[System requirements]
|Download and use the DIY app at https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy. For more
information, see link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md[Defender for
Endpoint on macOS].

|Linux (see
link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md#system-requirements[System
requirements]) |1. Run the following command, and look for a result of
*1*: `mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled`.2. Open a
Terminal window, and run the following command:
`curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt`.3.
Run the following command to list any detected threats:
`mdatp threat list`.For more information, see
link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md[Defender for Endpoint on
Linux].
|===

=== Confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is in passive mode on your endpoints

Now that your endpoints have been onboarded to Defender for Endpoint,
your next step is to make sure Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running
in passive mode. You can use one of several methods, as described in the
following table:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Method |What to do
|Command Prompt |1. On a Windows device, open Command Prompt.2. Type
`sc query windefend`, and then press Enter.3. Review the results to
confirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode.
The state of WinDefend returns *STOPPABLE* if it is in *Passive mode*
and *NOT_STOPPABLE* if it is in *Active mode*.

|PowerShell |1. On a Windows device, open Windows PowerShell as an
administrator.2. Run following PowerShell cmdlet:
`Get-MpComputerStatus|select AMRunningMode`. 3. Review the results. You
should see *Passive mode*.

|Windows Security app |1. On a Windows device, open the Windows Security
app.2. Select *Virus & threat protection*.3. Under *Who’s protecting
me?* select *Manage providers*.4. On the *Security providers* page,
under *Antivirus*, look for *Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on*.

|Task Manager |1. On a Windows device, open the Task Manager app.2.
Select the *Details* tab. Look for *MsMpEng.exe* in the list.
|===

____
[!NOTE] You might see _Windows Defender Antivirus_ instead of _Microsoft
Defender Antivirus_ in some versions of Windows. To learn more about
passive mode and active mode, see
link:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md#more-details-about-microsoft-defender-antivirus-states[More
details about Microsoft Defender Antivirus states].
____

==== Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server to passive mode manually

To set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server,
version 1803 or newer, or Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022,
follow these steps:

[arabic]
. Open Registry Editor, and then navigate to
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.
. Edit (or create) a DWORD entry called *ForceDefenderPassiveMode*, and
specify the following settings:
* Set the DWORD’s value to *1*.
* Under *Base*, select *Hexadecimal*.

____
[!NOTE] You can use other methods to set the registry key, such as the
following:

* link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn581922(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Preference]
* link:/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool[Local
Group Policy Object tool]
* link:/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs[A package in
Configuration Manager]
____

==== Start Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server 2016

If you are using Windows Server 2016, you might have to start Microsoft
Defender Antivirus manually. You can perform this task by using the
PowerShell cmdlet `mpcmdrun.exe -wdenable` on the device.

=== Get updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date is critical to assure
your devices have the latest technology and features needed to protect
against new malware and attack techniques, even if Microsoft Defender
Antivirus is running in passive mode. (See
link:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md[Microsoft Defender
Antivirus compatibility].)

There are two types of updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender
Antivirus up to date:

* Security intelligence updates
* Product updates

To get your updates, follow the guidance in
link:manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md[Manage
Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines].

=== Uninstall your non-Microsoft solution

If at this point you have:

* Onboarded your organization’s devices to Defender for Endpoint, and
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus is installed and enabled,

Then your next step is to uninstall your non-Microsoft antivirus,
antimalware, and endpoint protection solution. When you uninstall your
non-Microsoft solution, Microsoft Defender Antivirus switches from
passive mode to active mode. In most cases, this happens automatically.

____
[!IMPORTANT] If, for some reason, Microsoft Defender Antivirus does not
go into active mode after you have uninstalled your non-Microsoft
antivirus/antimalware solution, see
link:switch-to-mde-troubleshooting.md#microsoft-defender-antivirus-seems-to-be-stuck-in-passive-mode[Microsoft
Defender Antivirus seems to be stuck in passive mode].
____

To get help with uninstalling your non-Microsoft solution, contact their
technical support team.

=== Make sure Defender for Endpoint is working correctly

Now that you have onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, and you have
uninstalled your former non-Microsoft solution, your next step is to
make sure that Defender for Endpoint working correctly.

[arabic]
. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
(https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in.
. In the navigation pane, choose *Endpoints* > *Device inventory*.
There, you’ll be able to see protection status for devices.

To learn more, see link:machines-view-overview.md[Device inventory].
