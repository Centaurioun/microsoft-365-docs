Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you
explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in
your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible
access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and
potential threats.

Watch this video for a quick overview of advanced hunting and a short
tutorial that will get you started fast.

____

You can use the same threat-hunting queries to build custom detection
rules. These rules run automatically to check for and then respond to
suspected breach activity, misconfigured machines, and other findings.

=== Data freshness and update frequency

Advanced hunting data can be categorized into two distinct types, each
consolidated differently.

* *Event or activity data*: Populates tables about alerts, security
events, system events, and routine assessments. Advanced hunting
receives this data almost immediately after the sensors that collect
them successfully transmit them to Defender for Endpoint.
* *Entity data*: Populates tables with consolidated information about
users and devices. This data comes from both relatively static data
sources and dynamic sources, such as Active Directory entries and event
logs. To provide fresh data, tables are updated with any new information
every 15 minutes, adding rows that might not be fully populated. Every
24 hours, data is consolidated to insert a record that contains the
latest, most comprehensive data set about each entity.

=== Time zone

Time information in advanced hunting is currently in the UTC time zone.
