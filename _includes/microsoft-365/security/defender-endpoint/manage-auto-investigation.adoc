== Review remediation actions following an automated investigation

*Applies to:* -
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint Plan 2] - link:../defender-business/mdb-overview.md[Microsoft
Defender for Business]

=== Remediation actions

When an link:automated-investigations.md[automated investigation] runs,
a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts
can be _Malicious_, _Suspicious_, or _No threats found_.

Depending on

* the type of threat,
* the resulting verdict, and
* how your organization’s
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups[device
groups] are configured,

remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by
your organization’s security operations team.

____
[!NOTE] Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan
1 and Plan 2.
____

Here are a few examples:

* *Example 1*: Fabrikam’s device groups are set to *Full - remediate
threats automatically* (the recommended setting). In this case,
remediation actions are taken automatically for artifacts that are
considered to be malicious following an automated investigation (see
link:#review-completed-actions[Review completed actions]).
* *Example 2*: Contoso’s devices are included in a device group that is
set for *Semi - require approval for any remediation*. In this case,
Contoso’s security operations team must review and approve all
remediation actions following an automated investigation (see
link:#review-pending-actions[Review pending actions]).
* *Example 3*: Tailspin Toys has their device groups set to *No
automated response* (not recommended). In this case, automated
investigations do not occur. No remediation actions are taken or
pending, and no actions are logged in the
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center#the-action-center[Action
center] for their devices (see
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups#manage-device-groups[Manage
device groups]).

Whether taken automatically or upon approval, an automated investigation
can result in one or more of the remediation actions:

* Quarantine a file
* Remove a registry key
* Kill a process
* Stop a service
* Disable a driver
* Remove a scheduled task

=== Automation levels, automated investigation results, and resulting actions

team has more steps to take, depending on the results of an automated
investigation. The following table summarizes automation levels, results
of automated investigations, and what to do in each case.
