* *Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2* as part of the
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction[Defender

=== Mixed licensing scenarios

Suppose that your organization is using a mix of Microsoft endpoint
security subscriptions, such as Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and
Defender for Endpoint Plan 2. *Currently, the highest functional
Microsoft endpoint security subscription sets the experience for your
tenant*. In this example, your tenant experience would be Defender for
Endpoint Plan 2 for all users.

However, *you can contact support and request an override for your
tenant experience*. That is, you could request an override to keep the
Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 experience for all users.

* For more information about licenses and product terms, see
