Each onboarded device adds an additional endpoint detection and response
(EDR) sensor and increases visibility over breach activity in your
network. Onboarding also ensures that a device can be checked for
vulnerable components as well security configuration issues and can
receive critical remediation actions during attacks.

Before you can track and manage onboarding of devices:

=== Discover and track unprotected devices

The *Onboarding* card provides a high-level overview of your onboarding
rate by comparing the number of Windows devices that have actually
onboarded to Defender for Endpoint against the total number of
Intune-managed Windows devices.

____
[!NOTE] If you used Configuration Manager, the onboarding script, or
other onboarding methods that donâ€™t use Intune profiles, you might
encounter data discrepancies. To resolve these discrepancies, create a
corresponding Intune configuration profile for Defender for Endpoint
onboarding and assign that profile to your devices.
____

=== Onboard more devices with Intune profiles

Defender for Endpoint provides several convenient options for
link:onboard-configure.md[onboarding Windows devices]. For
Intune-managed devices, however, you can leverage Intune profiles to
conveniently deploy the Defender for Endpoint sensor to select devices,
effectively onboarding these devices to the service.

From the *Onboarding* card, select *Onboard more devices* to create and
assign a profile on Intune. The link takes you to the device compliance
page on Intune, which provides a similar overview of your onboarding
state.

From the device compliance page, create a configuration profile
specifically for the deployment of the Defender for Endpoint sensor and
assign that profile to the devices you want to onboard. To do this, you
can either:

* Select *Create a device configuration profile to configure ATP sensor*
to start with a predefined device configuration profile.
* Create the device configuration profile from scratch.
