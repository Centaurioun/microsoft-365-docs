xref:exploit-protection.adoc[Exploit protection] helps protect devices from malware that uses exploits to spread and infect other devices.
Mitigation can be applied to either the operating system or to an individual app.
Many of the features that were part of the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) are included in exploit protection.
(The EMET has reached its end of support.)

In audit, you can see how mitigation works for certain apps in a test environment.
This shows what _would_ have happened if you enabled exploit protection in your production environment.
This way, you can verify that exploit protection doesn't adversely affect your line-of-business apps, and see which suspicious or malicious events occur.

=== Enable exploit protection for testing

You can set mitigations in a testing mode for specific programs by using the Windows Security app or Windows PowerShell.

==== Windows Security app

. Open the Windows Security app.
Select the shield icon in the task bar or search the start menu for *Windows Security*.
. Select the *App & browser control* tile (or the app icon on the left menu bar) and then select *Exploit protection*.
. Go to *Program settings* and choose the app you want to apply protection to:
 .. If the app you want to configure is already listed, select it and then select *Edit*
 .. If the app is not listed at the top of the list select *Add program to customize*.
Then, choose how you want to add the app.
  *** Use *Add by program name* to have the mitigation applied to any running process with that name.
Specify a file with an extension.
You can enter a full path to limit the mitigation to only the app with that name in that location.
  *** Use *Choose exact file path* to use a standard Windows Explorer file picker window to find and select the file you want.
. After selecting the app, you'll see a list of all the mitigations that can be applied.
Choosing *Audit* will apply the mitigation in test mode only.
You'll be notified if you need to restart the process, app, or Windows.
. Repeat this procedure for all the apps and mitigations you want to configure.
Select *Apply* when you're done setting up your configuration.

==== PowerShell

To set app-level mitigations to test mode, use `Set-ProcessMitigation` with the *Audit mode* cmdlet.

Configure each mitigation in the following format:

[,powershell]
----
Set-ProcessMitigation -<scope> <app executable> -<action> <mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>,<mitigation or options>
----

Where:

* <Scope>:
 ** `-Name` to indicate the mitigations should be applied to a specific app.
Specify the app's executable after this flag.
* <Action>:
 ** `-Enable` to enable the mitigation
  *** `-Disable` to disable the mitigation
* <Mitigation>:
 ** The mitigation's cmdlet as defined in the following table.
Each mitigation is separated with a comma.

|===
| Mitigation | Test mode cmdlet

| Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG)
| `AuditDynamicCode`

| Block low integrity images
| `AuditImageLoad`

| Block untrusted fonts
| `AuditFont`, `FontAuditOnly`

| Code integrity guard
| `AuditMicrosoftSigned`, `AuditStoreSigned`

| Disable Win32k system calls
| `AuditSystemCall`

| Do not allow child processes
| `AuditChildProcess`
|===

For example, to enable Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) in test mode for an app named _testing.exe_, run the following command:

[,powershell]
----
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name c:\apps\lob\tests\testing.exe -Enable AuditDynamicCode
----

You can disable *audit mode* by replacing `-Enable` with `-Disable`.

=== Review exploit protection audit events

To review which apps would have been blocked, open Event Viewer and filter for the following events in the Security-Mitigations log.
