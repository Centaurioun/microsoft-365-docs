Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to send email notifications to specified recipients for new vulnerability events.
This feature enables you to identify a group of individuals who will immediately be informed and can act on the notifications based on the event.
The vulnerability information comes from xref:next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.adoc[Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management].

If you're using xref:../defender-business/mdb-overview.adoc[Defender for Business], you can set up vulnerability notifications for specific users (not roles or groups).

____
[!NOTE]

* Only users with 'Manage security settings' permissions can configure email notifications.
If you've chosen to use basic permissions management, users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator roles can configure email notifications.
xref:user-roles.adoc[Learn more about permission options]
* Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
____

The notification rules allow you to set the vulnerability events that trigger notifications, and add or remove email notification recipients.
New recipients get notified about vulnerabilities after they are added.

If you're using role-based access control (RBAC), recipients will only receive notifications based on the device groups that were configured in the notification rule.
Users with the proper permission can only create, edit, or delete notifications that are limited to their device group management scope.
Only users assigned to the Global administrator role can manage notification rules that are configured for all device groups.

The email notification includes basic information about the vulnerability event.
There are also links to filtered views in the Defender Vulnerability Management xref:tvm-security-recommendation.adoc[Security recommendations] and xref:tvm-weaknesses.adoc[Weaknesses] pages in the portal so you can further investigate.
For example, you could get a list of all exposed devices or get additional details about the vulnerability.

 ** Choose the vulnerability event(s) that you want to be notified about when they affect your organization:
  *** New vulnerability found (including severity threshold)
