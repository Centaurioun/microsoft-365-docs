The Device Health report provides information about the devices in your
organization. The report includes trending information showing the
sensor health state, antivirus status, OS platforms, Windows 10
versions, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus update versions.

____
[!IMPORTANT] For Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 to
appear in device health reports, these devices must be onboarded using
the modern unified solution package. For more information, see

[!TIP] *Performance tip* Due to a variety of factors (examples listed
below) Microsoft Defender Antivirus, like other antivirus software, can
cause performance issues on endpoint devices. In some cases, you might
need to tune the performance of Microsoft Defender Antivirus to
alleviate those performance issues. Microsoft’s *Performance analyzer*
is a PowerShell command-line tool that helps determine which files, file
paths, processes, and file extensions might be causing performance
issues; some examples are:

* Top paths that impact scan time
* Top files that impact scan time
* Top processes that impact scan time
* Top file extensions that impact scan time
* Combinations – for example:
** top files per extension
** top paths per extension
** top processes per path
** top scans per file
** top scans per file per process

You can use the information gathered using Performance analyzer to
better assess performance issues and apply remediation actions. See:
link:tune-performance-defender-antivirus.md[Performance analyzer for
Microsoft Defender Antivirus].
