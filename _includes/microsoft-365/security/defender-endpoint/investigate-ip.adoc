Examine possible communication between your devices and external
internet protocol (IP) addresses.

Identifying all devices in the organization that communicated with a
suspected or known malicious IP address, such as Command and Control
(C2) servers, helps determine the potential scope of breach, associated
files, and infected devices.

You can find information from the following sections in the IP address
view:

* IP geo information
* Alerts related to this IP
* IP in organization observations
* Prevalence in organization

=== IP geo information

In the left pane, the page provides IP details (if available). -
Organization (ISP) - ASN - Country - State - City - Carrier - Latitude -
Longitude - Postal code

=== Alerts related to this IP

The *Alerts related to this IP* section provides a list of alerts that
are associated with the IP.

=== IP observed in organization

The *IP observed in organization* section provides a list of devices
that have a connection with this IP and the last event details for each
device (the list is limited to 100 devices).

=== Prevalence

The *Prevalence* section displays how many devices have connected to
this IP address, and when the IP was first and last seen. You can filter
the results of this section by time period; the default period is 30
days.
