This topic describes how to Troubleshoot cloud connectivity issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

=== Run the connectivity test

To test if Defender for Endpoint on Mac can communicate to the cloud with the current network settings, run a connectivity test from the command line:

[,bash]
----
mdatp connectivity test
----

expected output:

[,bash]
----
Testing connection with https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping ... [OK]
Testing connection with https://eu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping ... [OK]
Testing connection with https://wu-cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping ... [OK]
Testing connection with https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report ... [OK]
Testing connection with https://winatp-gw-cus.microsoft.com/test ... [OK]

If the connectivity test fails, check if the device has Internet access and if link:microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac.md#network-connections[any of the endpoints required by the product] are blocked by a proxy or firewall.

Failures with curl error 35 or 60 indicate certificate pinning rejection, which indicates a potential issue with SSL or HTTPS inspection.
See instructions below regarding SSL inspection configuration.

=== Troubleshooting steps for environments without proxy or with Proxy autoconfig (PAC) or with Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD)

Use the following procedure to test that a connection is not blocked in an environment without a proxy or with Proxy autoconfig (PAC) or with Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD).

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs.

____
[!WARNING] Authenticated proxies are not supported.
Ensure that only PAC, WPAD, or a static proxy is being used.
SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are also not supported for security reasons.
Configure an exception for SSL inspection and your proxy server to directly pass through data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS to the relevant URLs without interception.
Adding your interception certificate to the global store will not allow for interception.
To test that a connection is not blocked: In a browser such as Microsoft Edge for Mac or Safari open https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report and https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping.
____

Optionally, in Terminal, run the following command:

[,bash]
----
curl -w ' %{url_effective}\n' 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report' 'https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping'
----

The output from this command should be similar to:

[,bash]
----
OK https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report
OK https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping
----
