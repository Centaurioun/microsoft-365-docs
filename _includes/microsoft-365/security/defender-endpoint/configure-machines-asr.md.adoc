xref:./attack-surface-reduction.adoc[Attack surface reduction (ASR) rules] identify and prevent typical malware exploits.
They control when and how potentially malicious code can run.
For example, they can prevent JavaScript or VBScript from launching a downloaded executable, block Win32 API calls from Office macros, and block processes that run from USB drives.

The _Attack surface management card_ is an entry point to tools in https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender portal] that you can use to:

* Understand how ASR rules are currently deployed in your organization.
* Review ASR detections and identify possible incorrect detections.
* Analyze the impact of exclusions and generate the list of file paths to exclude.

Select *Go to attack surface management* > *Reports* > *Attack surface reduction rules* > *Add exclusions*.
From there, you can navigate to other sections of Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
