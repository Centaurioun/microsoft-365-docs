{empty}[!INCLUDE link:../../includes/microsoft-defender.md[Microsoft 365

*Applies to:* -
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint Plan 1] -

Endpoint Plan 2]

You can specify additional definition sets for network traffic
inspection using Group Policy.

=== Use Group Policy to specify additional definition sets for network traffic inspection

[arabic]
. On your Group Policy management endpoint, open the
link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group
Policy Management Console].
. Go to *Windows Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Network
Inspection System*.
. Select *Specify additional definition sets for network traffic
inspection*. By default, this policy is set to *Not configured*.
. To edit the policy, select the *edit policy setting* link.
. Select *Enabled*, and then in the *Options* section, select *Showâ€¦*.
. Add entries to the list, and then select *OK*.
+
Each entry must be listed as a name-value pair, where the name is a
string representation of a definition set GUID. As an example, the
definition set GUID to enable test security intelligence is defined as:
`{b54b6ac9-a737-498e-9120-6616ad3bf590}`. The value is not used, so we
recommend setting it to `0`.
. Select *OK*, and then deploy your updated Group Policy Object. See
link:/windows/win32/srvnodes/group-policy[Group Policy Management
Console].
