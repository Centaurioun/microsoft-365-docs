=== Reinstall/enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your endpoints

On certain versions of Windows, Microsoft Defender Antivirus was likely
uninstalled or disabled when your non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware
solution was installed. When endpoints running Windows are onboarded to
Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender Antivirus can run in passive
mode alongside a non-Microsoft antivirus solution. To learn more, see
link:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md#antivirus-protection-without-defender-for-endpoint[Antivirus
protection with Defender for Endpoint].

As you’re making the switch to Defender for Endpoint, you might need to
take certain steps to reinstall or enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
The following table describes what to do on your Windows clients and
servers.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Endpoint type |What to do
|Windows clients (such as endpoints running Windows 10 and Windows 11)
|In general, you don’t need to take any action for Windows clients
(unless Microsoft Defender Antivirus has been uninstalled). In general,
Microsoft Defender Antivirus should still be installed, but is most
likely disabled at this point of the migration process. When a
non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware solution is installed and the
clients aren’t yet onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft
Defender Antivirus is disabled automatically. Later, when the client
endpoints are onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, if those endpoints are
running a non-Microsoft antivirus solution, Microsoft Defender Antivirus
goes into passive mode. If the non-Microsoft antivirus solution is
uninstalled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus goes into active mode
automatically.

|Windows servers |On Windows Server, you’ll need to reinstall Microsoft
Defender Antivirus, and set it to passive mode manually. On Windows
servers, when a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware is installed,
Microsoft Defender Antivirus can’t run alongside the non-Microsoft
antivirus solution. In those cases, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is
disabled or uninstalled manually. To reinstall or enable Microsoft
Defender Antivirus on Windows Server, perform the following tasks: -
link:enable-update-mdav-to-latest-ws.md#re-enable-microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-if-it-was-disabled[Re-enable
Defender Antivirus on Windows Server if it was disabled]-
link:enable-update-mdav-to-latest-ws.md#re-enable-microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-if-it-was-uninstalled[Re-enable
Defender Antivirus on Windows Server if it was uninstalled]-
link:#set-microsoft-defender-antivirus-to-passive-mode-on-windows-server[Set
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server] If you
run into issues reinstalling or re-enabling Microsoft Defender
Antivisrus on Windows Server, see
link:switch-to-mde-troubleshooting.md#microsoft-defender-antivirus-is-getting-uninstalled-on-windows-server[Troubleshooting:
Microsoft Defender Antivirus is getting uninstalled on Windows Server].

____
[!TIP] To learn more about Microsoft Defender Antivirus states with
non-Microsoft antivirus protection, see
link:microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md[Microsoft Defender
Antivirus compatibility].
____

==== Set Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server

____
[!TIP] You can now run Microsoft Defender Antivirus in passive mode on
Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016. For more information, see
link:configure-server-endpoints.md#options-to-install-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-packages[Options
to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint].
____

[arabic]
. Open Registry Editor, and then navigate to
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`.
. Edit (or create) a DWORD entry called *ForceDefenderPassiveMode*, and
specify the following settings:
* Set the DWORD’s value to *1*.
* Under *Base*, select *Hexadecimal*.

____
[!NOTE] After onboarding to Defender for Endpoint, you might have to set
Microsoft Defender Antivirus to passive mode on Windows Server. To
validate that passive mode was set as expected, search for *Event 5007*
in the *Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender Operational* log (located at
`C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`), and confirm that either the
*ForceDefenderPassiveMode* or *PassiveMode* registry keys were set to
*0x1*.
____

==== Are you using Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016?

You can now run Microsoft Defender Antivirus in passive mode on Windows
Server 2012 R2 and 2016 using the method above. For more information,
see
link:configure-server-endpoints.md#options-to-install-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-packages[Options
to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint].

=== Configure Defender for Endpoint

This step of the migration process involves configuring Microsoft
Defender Antivirus for your endpoints. We recommend using Intune;
however, you can any of the methods that are listed in the following
table:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\exclusions`.2.
Import the registry key. Here are two examples:- Local path:
`regedit.exe /s c:\temp\MDAV_Exclusion.reg`- Network share:
`regedit.exe /s \\FileServer\ShareName\MDAV_Exclusion.reg`
|===

==== Keep the following points about exclusions in mind

When you add
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus[exclusions
to Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans], you should add path and process
exclusions.

Keep the following points in mind:

* _Path exclusions_ exclude specific files and whatever those files
access.
* _Process exclusions_ exclude whatever a process touches, but doesn’t
exclude the process itself.
* List your process exclusions using their full path and not by their
name only. (The name-only method is less secure.)
* If you list each executable (.exe) as both a path exclusion and a
process exclusion, the process and whatever it touches are excluded.

=== Set up your device groups, device collections, and organizational units

Device groups, device collections, and organizational units enable your
security team to manage and assign security policies efficiently and
effectively. The following table describes each of these groups and how
to configure them. Your organization might not use all three collection
types.

____
[!NOTE] Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan
1 and Plan 2.
____

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Collection type |What to do
|link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups[Device
groups] (formerly called _machine groups_) enable your security
operations team to configure security capabilities, such as automated
investigation and remediation. Device groups are also useful for
assigning access to those devices so that your security operations team
can take remediation actions if needed. Device groups are created while
the attack was detected and stopped, alerts, such as an ``initial access
alert,'' were triggered and appeared in the
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender[Microsoft
365 Defender portal]. |1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal
(https://security.microsoft.com).2. In the navigation pane on the left,
choose *Settings* > *Endpoints* > *Permissions* > *Device groups*.3.
Choose *+ Add device group*.4. Specify a name and description for the
device group.5. In the *Automation level* list, select an option. (We
recommend *Full - remediate threats automatically*.) To learn more about
the various automation levels, see
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations#how-threats-are-remediated[How
threats are remediated].6. Specify conditions for a matching rule to
determine which devices belong to the device group. For example, you can
choose a domain, OS versions, or even use
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-tags[device
tags].7. On the *User access* tab, specify roles that should have access
to the devices that are included in the device group.8. Choose *Done*.

|link:/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/collections/introduction-to-collections[Device
