*Welcome to the Prepare phase of link:switch-to-mde-overview.md#the-migration-process[switching to Defender for Endpoint]*.

This migration phase includes the following steps:

. <<get-and-deploy-updates-across-your-organizations-devices,Get and deploy updates across your organization's devices>>
. <<get-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint,Get Defender for Endpoint>>.
. <<grant-access-to-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal,Grant access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal>>.
. <<configure-device-proxy-and-internet-connectivity-settings,Configure device proxy and internet connectivity settings>>.

=== Get and deploy updates across your organization's devices

As a best practice, keep your organization's devices and endpoints up to date.
Make sure your existing endpoint protection and antivirus solution is up to date, and that the operating systems and apps your organization is also have the latest updates.
Doing this now can help prevent problems later as you migrate to Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

==== Make sure your existing solution is up to date

Keep your existing endpoint protection solution up to date, and make sure that your organization's devices have the latest security updates.

See your solution provider's documentation.

==== Make sure your organization's devices are up to date

=== Get Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Now that you've updated your organization's devices, the next step is to get Defender for Endpoint, assign licenses, and make sure the service is provisioned.

. Buy or try Defender for Endpoint today.
https://aka.ms/mdatp[Start a free trial or request a quote].
. Verify that your licenses are properly provisioned.
link:production-deployment.md#check-license-state[Check your license state].
. Set up your dedicated cloud instance of Defender for Endpoint.
See link:production-deployment.md#tenant-configuration[Defender for Endpoint setup: Tenant configuration].
. If endpoints (such as devices) in your organization use a proxy to access the internet, see link:production-deployment.md#network-configuration[Defender for Endpoint setup: Network configuration].

At this point, you are ready to grant access to your security administrators and security operators who will use the https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].

____
[!NOTE] The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is sometimes referred to as the Defender for Endpoint portal, and can be accessed at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[https://security.microsoft.com].
The former Microsoft Defender Security Center (https://securitycenter.windows.com) will soon redirect to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
To learn more, see xref:portal-overview.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender portal overview].
____

=== Grant access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139[Microsoft 365 Defender portal] is where you access and configure features and capabilities of Defender for Endpoint.
To learn more, see xref:use.adoc[Overview of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal].

Permissions to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal can be granted by using either basic permissions or role-based access control (RBAC).
We recommend using RBAC so that you have more granular control over permissions.

. Plan the roles and permissions for your security administrators and security operators.
See link:prepare-deployment.md#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control].
. Set up and configure RBAC.
We recommend using link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune[Intune] to configure RBAC, especially if your organization is using a combination of Windows 10, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.
See link:/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control[setting up RBAC using Intune].
+
If your organization requires a method other than Intune, choose one of the following options:

 ** link:/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/configure-role-based-administration[Configuration Manager]
 ** link:/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/agpm[Advanced Group Policy Management]
 ** link:/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview[Windows Admin Center]

. Grant access to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
(Need help?
See xref:rbac.adoc[Manage portal access using RBAC].

=== Configure device proxy and internet connectivity settings

To enable communication between your devices and Defender for Endpoint, configure proxy and internet settings.
