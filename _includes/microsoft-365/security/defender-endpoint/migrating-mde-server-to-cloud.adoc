This article guides you in migrating servers from Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint (MDE) to Defender for Cloud.

https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint[Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint] (MDE) is an enterprise endpoint security platform
designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and
respond to advanced threats.

https://azure.microsoft.com/services/defender-for-cloud/[Microsoft
Defender for Cloud] is a solution for cloud security posture management
(CSPM) and cloud workload protection (CWP) that finds weak spots across
your cloud configuration. It also helps strengthen the overall security
posture of your environment, and can protect workloads across
multi-cloud and hybrid environments from evolving threats.

While both products offer server protection capabilities, Microsoft
Defender for Cloud is our primary solution to protect infrastructure
resources, including servers.

=== How do I migrate my servers from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

If you have servers onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, the migration
process varies depending on machine type, but there’s a set of shared
prerequisites.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a subscription-based service in the
Microsoft Azure portal. Therefore, Defender for Cloud and the underlying
plans like Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2 need to be enabled on
Azure subscriptions.

To enable Defender for Servers for Azure VMs and non-Azure machines
connected through link:/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview[Azure
Arc-enabled servers], follow this guideline:

[arabic]
. If you aren’t already using Azure, plan your environment following the
link:/azure/architecture/framework/[Azure Well-Architected Framework].
. Enable link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/get-started[Microsoft Defender
for Cloud] on your subscription(s).
. Enable one of the Microsoft Defender for Server plans on your
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-enhanced-security[subscription(s)].
In case you’re using Defender for Servers Plan 2, make sure to also
enable it on the Log Analytics workspace your machines are connected to;
it will enable you to use optional features like File Integrity
Monitoring, Adaptive Application Controls and more.
. Make sure the
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint?tabs=windows[MDE
integration] is enabled on your subscription. If you have pre-existing
Azure subscriptions, you may see one (or both) of the two opt-in buttons
shown in the image below.

:::image type=``content'' source=``images/mde-integration.png''
alt-text=``Screenshot that shows how to enable MDE integration.''
lightbox=``images/mde-integration.png'':::
+
If you have any of these buttons in your environment, make sure to
enable integration for both. On new subscriptions, both options will be
enabled by default. In this case, you will not see these buttons in your
environment.
. Make sure the connectivity requirements for Azure Arc are met.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud requires all on-premises and non-Azure
machines to be connected via the Azure Arc agent. In addition, Azure Arc
doesn’t support all MDE supported operating systems. So, learn how to
plan for link:/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-at-scale-deployment[Azure
Arc deployments here].
. _Recommended:_ If you want to see vulnerability findings in Defender
for Cloud, make sure to enable
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-data-collection?tabs=autoprovision-va[Microsoft
Defender Vulnerability Management] for Defender for Cloud.

=== How do I migrate existing Azure VMs to Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

For Azure VMs, no extra steps are required, these are automatically
onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, thanks to the native
integration between the Azure platform and Defender for Cloud.

=== How do I migrate on-premises machines to Microsoft Defender for Servers?

Once all prerequisites are met,
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-machines?pivots=azure-arc[connect]
your on-premises machines via Azure Arc-connected servers.

=== How do I migrate VMs from AWS or GCP environments?

[arabic]
. Create a new multi-cloud connector on your subscription. (For more
information on connector, see
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws?pivots=env-settings[AWS
accounts] or
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-gcp?pivots=env-settings[GCP
projects].
. On your multi-cloud connector, enable Defender for Servers on
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws?pivots=env-settings#prerequisites[AWS]
or
link:/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-gcp?pivots=env-settings#configure-the-servers-plan[GCP]
connectors.
. Enable auto-provisioning on the multi-cloud connector for the Azure
Arc agent, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint extension, Vulnerability
Assessment and, optionally, Log Analytics extension.

For more information, see https://aka.ms/mdcmc[Defender for Cloud’s
multicloud capabilities].

=== What happens once all migration steps are completed?

Once you’ve completed the relevant migration steps, Microsoft Defender
for Cloud will deploy the `MDE.Windows` or `MDE.Linux` extension to your
Azure VMs and non-Azure machines connected through Azure Arc (including
VMs in AWS and GCP compute).

The extension acts as a management and deployment interface, which will
orchestrate and wrap the MDE installation scripts inside the operating
system and reflect its provisioning state to the Azure management plane.
The installation process will recognize an existing Defender for
Endpoint installation and connect it to Defender for Cloud by
automatically adding Defender for Endpoint service tags.

In case you have Windows Server 2012 R2 or 2016 machines that are
provisioned with the legacy, Log Analytics-based Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint solution, Microsoft Defender for Cloud’s deployment process
will deploy the Defender for Endpoint
link:configure-server-endpoints.md#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution[unified
solution]. After successful deployment, it will stop and disable the
legacy Defender for Endpoint process on these machines.
