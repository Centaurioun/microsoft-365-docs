____

Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to send email notifications to
specified recipients for new vulnerability events. This feature enables
you to identify a group of individuals who will immediately be informed
and can act on the notifications based on the event. The vulnerability
information comes from link:next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt.md[Microsoft
Defender Vulnerability Management].

If you’re using link:../defender-business/mdb-overview.md[Defender for
Business], you can set up vulnerability notifications for specific users
(not roles or groups).

____
[!NOTE] - Only users with `Manage security settings' permissions can
configure email notifications. If you’ve chosen to use basic permissions
management, users with Security Administrator or Global Administrator
roles can configure email notifications. link:user-roles.md[Learn more
about permission options] - Device group creation is supported in
Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
____

The notification rules allow you to set the vulnerability events that
trigger notifications, and add or remove email notification recipients.
New recipients get notified about vulnerabilities after they are added.

If you’re using role-based access control (RBAC), recipients will only
receive notifications based on the device groups that were configured in
the notification rule. Users with the proper permission can only create,
edit, or delete notifications that are limited to their device group
management scope. Only users assigned to the Global administrator role
can manage notification rules that are configured for all device groups.

The email notification includes basic information about the
vulnerability event. There are also links to filtered views in the
Defender Vulnerability Management
link:tvm-security-recommendation.md[Security recommendations] and
link:tvm-weaknesses.md[Weaknesses] pages in the portal so you can
further investigate. For example, you could get a list of all exposed
devices or get additional details about the vulnerability.

exploit or vulnerability events, such as a new public exploit. For each
rule, multiple event types can be selected.
