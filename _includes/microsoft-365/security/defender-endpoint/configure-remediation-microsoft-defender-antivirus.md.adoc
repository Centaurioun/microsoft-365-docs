*Platforms*

When Microsoft Defender Antivirus runs a scan, it attempts to remediate or remove threats that are detected.
You can configure how Microsoft Defender Antivirus should address certain threats, whether a restore point should be created before remediating, and when threats should be removed.

This article describes how to configure these settings by using Group Policy, but you can also use link:/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies#threat-overrides-settings[Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager] and link:/intune/device-restrictions-configure[Microsoft Intune].

You can also use the link:/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference[`Set-MpPreference` PowerShell cmdlet] or link:/previous-versions/windows/desktop/defender/windows-defender-wmiv2-apis-portal[`MSFT_MpPreference` WMI class] to configure these settings.

=== Configure remediation options

. On your Group Policy management computer, open the link:/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731212(v=ws.11)[Group Policy Management Console], right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click *Edit*.
. In the *Group Policy Management Editor* go to *Computer configuration* and select *Administrative templates*.
. Expand the tree to *Windows components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus*.
. Using the table below, select a location, and then edit the policy as needed.
. Select *OK*.

____
[!IMPORTANT] Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects and remediates files based on many factors.
Sometimes, completing a remediation requires a reboot.
Even if the detection is later determined to be a false positive, the reboot must be completed to ensure all additional remediation steps have been completed.

If you are certain Microsoft Defender Antivirus quarantined a file based on a false positive, you can restore the file from quarantine after the device reboots.
See xref:restore-quarantined-files-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Restore quarantined files in Microsoft Defender Antivirus].

To avoid this problem in the future, you can exclude files from the scans.
See xref:configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Configure and validate exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans].
