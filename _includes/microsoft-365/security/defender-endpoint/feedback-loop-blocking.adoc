*Applies to:* -
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint Plan 2] - Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms* - Windows

=== Overview

Feedback-loop blocking, also referred to as rapid protection, is a
component of
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/behavioral-blocking-containment[behavioral
blocking and containment capabilities] in
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/[Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint]. With feedback-loop blocking, devices across your organization
are better protected from attacks.

=== How feedback-loop blocking works

When a suspicious behavior or file is detected, such as by
link:/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10[Microsoft
Defender Antivirus], information about that artifact is sent to multiple
classifiers. The rapid protection loop engine inspects and correlates
the information with other signals to arrive at a decision as to whether
to block a file. Checking and classifying artifacts happens quickly. It
results in rapid blocking of confirmed malware, and drives protection
across the entire ecosystem.

With rapid protection in place, an attack can be stopped on a device,
other devices in the organization, and devices in other organizations,
as an attack attempts to broaden its foothold.

=== Configuring feedback-loop blocking

If your organization is using Defender for Endpoint, feedback-loop
blocking is enabled by default. However, rapid protection occurs through
a combination of Defender for Endpoint capabilities, machine learning
protection features, and signal-sharing across Microsoft security
services. Make sure the following features and capabilities of Defender
for Endpoint are enabled and configured:
