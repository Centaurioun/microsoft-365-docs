=== Endpoint URI and versioning

==== Endpoint URI

____
The service base URI is: https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com

The queries based OData have the '/api' prefix.
For example, to get Alerts you can send GET request to https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts
____

==== Versioning

____
The API supports versioning.

The current version is *V1.0*.

To use a specific version, use this format: `+https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/{Version}+`.
For example: `+https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/v1.0/alerts+`

If you don't specify any version (e.g.
`+https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts+`) you will get to the latest version.
