This article describes how to configure scheduled scans using Group Policy.
To learn more about scheduling scans and about scan types, see xref:schedule-antivirus-scans.adoc[Configure scheduled quick or full Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans].

=== Configure antivirus scans using Group Policy

. On your Group Policy management machine, in the Group Policy Editor, go to *Computer configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Scan*.
. Right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure, and then select *Edit*.
. Specify settings for the Group Policy Object, and then select *OK*.
. Repeat steps 1-4 for each setting you want to configure.
. Deploy your Group Policy Object as you normally do.
If you need help with Group Policy Objects, see link:/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-a-group-policy-object[Create a Group Policy Object].

[!NOTE] When configuring scheduled scans, the setting *Start the scheduled scan only when computer is on but not in use*, which is enabled by default, can impact the expected scheduled time by requiring the machine to be idle first.

For weekly scans, default behavior on Windows Server is to scan outside of automatic maintenance when the machine is idle.
The default on Windows 10 and later is to scan during automatic maintenance when the machine is idle.
To change this behavior, modify the settings by disabling *ScanOnlyIfIdle*, and then define a schedule.
