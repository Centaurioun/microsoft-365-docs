When Microsoft Defender Antivirus finds a suspicious file, it can prevent the file from running while it queries the xref:cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud service].

The default period that the file is xref:configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[blocked] is 10 seconds.
If you're a security administrator, you can specify more time to wait before the file is allowed to run.
Extending the cloud block timeout period can help ensure there is enough time to receive a proper determination from the Microsoft Defender Antivirus cloud service.

=== Prerequisites to use the extended cloud block timeout

xref:configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Block at first sight] and its prerequisites must be enabled before you can specify an extended timeout period.
