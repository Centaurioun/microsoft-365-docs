Microsoft Defender for Endpoint now seamlessly integrates with Microsoft
Defender for IoT. This integration extends your device discovery
capabilities with the agentless monitoring capabilities provided by
Defender for IoT. The Defender for IoT integration provides increased
visibility to help locate, identify, and secure the enterprise IoT
devices in your network, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
devices, printers, and cameras.

This allows organizations to take advantage of a single integrated
solution that secures all of their IoT, and Operational Technology (OT)
infrastructure. For more information, see
link:/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/overview-eiot[Enterprise IoT
network protection].

The Defender for IoT integration gives you a single unified view of your
complete OT/IoT inventory alongside the rest of your IT devices
(workstations, servers, and mobile). Customers who’ve onboarded to
Defender for IoT will also get information on alerts, vulnerabilities
and security recommendations for their IoT devices.

=== Prerequisites

To modify settings for your Defender for Endpoint integration, the user
must have the following roles:

* Tenant Global Administrator in Azure Active Directory
* Security Administrator for the Azure subscription that will be used
for the Microsoft Defender for IoT integration

=== Onboard a Defender for IoT plan

your IoT devices with the device inventory for organizations].

=== View devices, alerts, recommendations, and vulnerabilities

After onboarding to a Defender for IoT plan, view detected data and
security assessments in the following locations:

* View device data in Defender for Endpoint or Defender for IoT
* View link:alerts-queue-endpoint-detection-response.md[alerts],
link:../defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-security-recommendation.md[recommendations],
and

in the https://security.microsoft.com[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].

==== Shared device inventory

Defender for Endpoint customers can also set up the Enterprise IoT
network sensor (currently in *Public Preview*) to gain more visibility
into additional IoT segments of the corporate network that were not
previously covered by Defender for Endpoint. Customers that have set up
an Enterprise IoT network sensor will be able to see all discovered
devices in the *Device inventory* in either Defender for Endpoint or
Defender for IoT.

https://security.microsoft.com/[https://security.microsoft.com] portal:

[arabic]
. Select *Settings* > *Device discovery* > *Enterprise IoT*
. Under *Set up network sensors* choose the *Microsoft Defender for IoT*
link

This brings you to the sensor setup process in the Azure portal. For
