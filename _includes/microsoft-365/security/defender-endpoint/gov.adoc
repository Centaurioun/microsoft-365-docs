=== Required connectivity settings

If a proxy or firewall is blocking all traffic by default and allowing
only specific domains through, add the domains listed in the
downloadable sheet to the allowed domains list.

The following downloadable spreadsheet lists the services and their
associated URLs your network must be able to connect to. Verify there
are no firewall or network-filtering rules that would deny access to
these URLs, or create an _allow_ rule specifically for them.
