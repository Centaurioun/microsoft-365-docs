Follow the corresponding instructions depending on your preferred deployment method.

____
[!NOTE] The status of a device will be switched to link:fix-unhealthy-sensors.md#inactive-devices[Inactive] 7 days after offboarding.

Offboarded devices' data (such as Timeline, Alerts, Vulnerabilities, etc.) will remain in the portal until the configured link:data-storage-privacy.md#how-long-will-microsoft-store-my-data-what-is-microsofts-data-retention-policy[retention period] expires.

The device's profile (without data) will remain in the xref:machines-view-overview.adoc[Devices List] for no longer than 180 days.

In addition, devices that are not active in the last 30 days are not factored in on the data that reflects your organization's Defender Vulnerability Management xref:tvm-exposure-score.adoc[exposure score] and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices.

To view only active devices, you can filter by link:machines-view-overview.md#use-filters-to-customize-the-device-inventory-views[sensor health state], xref:machine-tags.adoc[device tags] or xref:machine-groups.adoc[machine groups].
