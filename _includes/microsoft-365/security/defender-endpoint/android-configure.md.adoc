=== Conditional Access with Defender for Endpoint on Android

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android along with Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory enables enforcing Device compliance and Conditional Access policies based on device risk levels.
Defender for Endpoint is a Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) solution that you can deploy to leverage this capability through Intune.

For more information about how to set up Defender for Endpoint on Android and Conditional Access, see link:/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection[Defender for Endpoint and Intune].

=== Configure custom indicators

____
[!NOTE] Defender for Endpoint on Android only supports creating custom indicators for IP addresses and URLs/domains.
____

Defender for Endpoint on Android enables admins to configure custom indicators to support Android devices as well.
For more information on how to configure custom indicators, see xref:manage-indicators.adoc[Manage indicators].

=== Configure web protection

Defender for Endpoint on Android allows IT Administrators the ability to configure the web protection feature.
This capability is available within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin center.

xref:web-protection-overview.adoc[Web protection] helps to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks.
Note that anti-phishing and custom indicators (URL and IP addresses) are supported as part of web protection.
Web content filtering is currently not supported on mobile platforms.

____
[!NOTE] Defender for Endpoint on Android would use a VPN in order to provide the Web Protection feature.
This is not a regular VPN and is a local/self-looping VPN that does not take traffic outside the device.
For more information, see link:/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection-manage-android[Configure web protection on devices that run Android].

=== Network Protection

____
[!NOTE] Network Protection on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now in public preview.
The following information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released.
Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.
____

This feature provides protection against rogue Wi-Fi related threats and rogue certificates which are the primary attack vector for Wi-Fi networks.
Admins can list the root Certificate Authority (CA) and private root CA certificates in Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin center and establish trust with endpoints.
It provides the user a guided experience to connect to secure networks and also notifies them if a related threat is detected.

It includes several admin controls to offer flexibility, such as the ability to configure the feature from within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin center as well as add trusted certificates.
Admins can also enable link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/android-configure#privacy-controls[privacy controls] to configure the data that is sent by Defender for Endpoint from Android devices.

Network protection in Microsoft Defender for endpoint is enabled by default.
Admins can use the following steps to *configure Network protection in Android devices.*

. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin, navigate to Apps > App configuration policies.
Create a new App configuration policy.

____

. If your organization uses root CA's which could be private in nature, explicit trust needs to be established between Intune (MDM solution) and user's devices so that defender doesn't detect flag them as rogue certificates.
+
To establish trust for the root CAs use *'Trusted CA certificate list for Network Protection (Preview)'* as the key and in value add the *'comma separated list of certificate thumbprints'*.
+
