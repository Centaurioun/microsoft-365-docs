In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, admins can use the unified submissions feature to submit files and file hashes (SHAs) to Microsoft for review.
The unified submissions experience is a one-stop shop for submitting emails, URLs, email attachments, and files in one, easy-to-use submission experience.
Admins can use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal or the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Alert page to submit suspicious files.

=== What do you need to know before you begin?

* The new unified submissions experience is available only in subscriptions that include Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2, or Microsoft Defender for Office Plan 2.
* To submit files to Microsoft, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:
 ** *Organization Management*, *Security Administrator*, or *Security Reader* in the xref:../office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.adoc[Microsoft 365 Defender portal].
* For more information about how you can submit spam, phish, URLs, and email attachments to Microsoft, see xref:../office-365-security/report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.adoc[Report messages and files to Microsoft].

=== Report items to Microsoft from the portal

If you have a file that you suspect might be malware or is being incorrectly detected (false positive), you can submit it to Microsoft for analysis using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com/.
