*Applies to:*

You can use PowerShell to perform various functions in Windows Defender.
Similar to the command prompt or command line, PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration.
You can read more about it in the link:/powershell/scripting/overview[PowerShell documentation].

For a list of the cmdlets and their functions and available parameters, see the link:/powershell/module/defender[Defender Antivirus cmdlets] topic.

PowerShell cmdlets are most useful in Windows Server environments that don't rely on a graphical user interface (GUI) to configure software.

____
[!NOTE] PowerShell cmdlets should not be used as a replacement for a full network policy management infrastructure, such as link:/configmgr[Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager], xref:use-group-policy-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Group Policy Management Console], or https://www.microsoft.com/download/101445[Microsoft Defender Antivirus Group Policy ADMX templates].
____

Changes made with PowerShell will affect local settings on the endpoint where the changes are deployed or made.
This means that deployments of policy with Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, or Microsoft Intune can overwrite changes made with PowerShell.

You can xref:configure-local-policy-overrides-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[configure which settings can be overridden locally with local policy overrides].

PowerShell is typically installed under the folder `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell`.
