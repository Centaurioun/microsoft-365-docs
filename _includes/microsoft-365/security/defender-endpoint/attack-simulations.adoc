You might want to experience Defender for Endpoint before you onboard
more than a few devices to the service. To do this, you can run
controlled attack simulations on a few test devices. After running the
simulated attacks, you can review how Defender for Endpoint surfaces
malicious activity and explore how it enables an efficient response.

=== Before you begin

To run any of the provided simulations, you need at least
link:onboard-configure.md[one onboarded device].

Read the walkthrough document provided with each attack scenario. Each
document includes OS and application requirements as well as detailed
instructions that are specific to an attack scenario.

=== Run a simulation

[arabic]
. In *Endpoints* > *Evaluation & tutorials* > *Tutorials & simulations*,
select which of the available attack scenarios you would like to
simulate:
* *Scenario 1: Document drops backdoor* - simulates delivery of a
socially engineered lure document. The document launches a specially
crafted backdoor that gives attackers control.
* *Scenario 2: PowerShell script in fileless attack* - simulates a
fileless attack that relies on PowerShell, showcasing attack surface
reduction and device learning detection of malicious memory activity.
* *Scenario 3: Automated incident response* - triggers automated
investigation, which automatically hunts for and remediates breach
artifacts to scale your incident response capacity.
. Download and read the corresponding walkthrough document provided with
your selected scenario.
. Download the simulation file or copy the simulation script by
navigating to *Evaluation & tutorials* > *Tutorials & simulations*. You
can choose to download the file or script on the test device but it’s
not mandatory.
. Run the simulation file or script on the test device as instructed in
the walkthrough document.

____
[!NOTE] Simulation files or scripts mimic attack activity but are
actually benign and will not harm or compromise the test device.
