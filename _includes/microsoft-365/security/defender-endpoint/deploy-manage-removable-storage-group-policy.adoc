The Removable Storage Access Control feature enables you to apply a
policy by using group policy to either user or device, or both.

=== Device Control Removable Storage Access Control policies

You can use the following properties to create a removable storage
group.

[!NOTE] Comments using XML comment notation `<!-- COMMENT -->` can be
used in the Rule and Group XML files, but they must be inside the first
XML tag, not the first line of the XML file.

=== Licensing requirements

Before you get started with Removable Storage Access Control, you must
confirm your
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=2[Microsoft
365 subscription]. To access and use Removable Storage Access Control
through group policy, you must have Microsoft 365 E5.

=== Deploy using group policy

[arabic]
. Enable or Disable Removable Storage Access Control:
+
You can enable or disable Device control as follows:
* Go to *Computer Configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows
Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Features* > *Device
Control*.
* In the *Device Control* window, select *Enabled*.

[!NOTE] If you don’t see this group policy objects, you need to add the
group policy administrative template. You can download administrative
template (WindowsDefender.adml and WindowsDefender.admx) from
https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/tree/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples.

. Set Default Enforcement:
+
You can set default access (Deny or Allow) for all Device Control
features (RemovableMediaDevices, CdRomDevices, WpdDevices,
PrinterDevices).
+
For example, you can have either a Deny or an Allow policy for
RemovableMediaDevices, but not for CdRomDevices or WpdDevices. You set
Default Deny through this policy, then Read/Write/Execute access to
CdRomDevices or WpdDevices will be blocked. If you only want to manage
storage, make sure to create Allow policy for Printer. Otherwise, this
Default Enforcement will be applied to Printer as well.
* Go to *Computer Configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows
Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Features* > *Device
Control* > *Select Device Control Default Enforcement*
* In the *Select Device Control Default Enforcement* pane, select
*Default Deny*:

. Create one XML file for removable storage group(s):
+
Use the properties in removable storage group to create an XML file for
the Removable storage group(s), save the XML file to network share, and
define the setting as follows:
* Go to *Computer Configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows
Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Device Control* >
*Define device control policy groups*.

* In the *Define device control policy groups* window, specify the
network share file path containing the XML groups data.
+
Take a look at the *Overview* > *Removable storage group*. You can
create different group types. Here’s one group example XML file for any
removable storage and CDROM and Windows portable devices and approved
USBs group:

. Create one XML file for access policy rule(s):
+
Use the properties in removable storage access policy rule(s) to create
an XML for each group’s removable storage access policy rule, save the
XML file to network share, and deliver the setting as follows:
* Go to *Computer Configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows
Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Device Control* >
*Define device control policy rules*.

* In the *Define device control policy rules* window, select *Enabled*,
and enter the network share file path containing the XML rules data.

Take a look at the *Overview* -> *Access policy rule*, you can use
*Parameters* to set condition for specific Entry. Here’s one

. Set location for a copy of the file (evidence):
+
If you want to have a copy of the file (evidence) when Write access
happens, set right *Options* in your removable storage access policy
rule in the XML file, and then specify the location where system can
save the copy.
* Go to *Computer Configuration* > *Administrative Templates* > *Windows
Components* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* > *Device Control* >
*Define Device Control evidence data remote location*.
* In the *Define Device Control evidence data remote location* pane,
select *Enabled*, and then specify the local or network share folder
path.

=== Scenarios

Here are some common scenarios to help you familiarize with Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint Removable Storage Access Control. In the following
samples, `Default Enforcement' hasn’t been used because the `Default
Enforcement' will apply to both the removable storage and the printer.

==== Scenario 1: Prevent Write and Execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs

For this scenario, you need to create two groups - one group for any
removable storage and another group for approved USBs. You also need to
create two policies - one policy to deny Write and Execute access for
any removable storage group and the other policy to audit the approved
USBs group.

[arabic]
. Create groups
[arabic]
.. Group 1: Any removable storage, CD/DVD, and Windows portable devices.

[arabic, start=2]
.. Group 2: Approved USBs based on device properties.

screenshot of approved USBs]
+
Combine these two groups into
https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-devicecontrol/blob/main/Removable%20Storage%20Access%20Control%20Samples/Group%20Policy/Demo_Groups.xml[one
XML file]. See step 3 from the

group but allow approved USBs.

+
What does `54' mean in the policy? It’s 18 + 36 = 54:
* Write access: disk level 2 + file system level 16 = 18.
* Execute: disk level 4 + file system level 32 = 36.

XML file]. See step 4 from the
link:deploy-manage-removable-storage-group-policy.md#deploy-using-group-policy[Deploy
using group policy] section to deploy this configuration.

==== Scenario 2: Audit Write and Execute access for all but block specific blocked USBs

For this scenario, you need to create two groups - one group for any
removable storage and another group for blocked USBs. You also need to
create two policies - one policy to audit Write and Execute access for
any removable storage group and the other policy to deny the blocked
USBs group.

+
What does `54' mean in the policy? It’s 18 + 36 = 54:
* Write access: disk level 2 + file system level 16 = 18.
* Execute: disk level 4 + file system level 32 = 36.

Combine these two policy rules into

XML file]. See step 4 from the
link:deploy-manage-removable-storage-group-policy.md#deploy-using-group-policy[Deploy
using group policy] section to deploy this configuration.

==== Scenario 3: Block read and execute access to specific file extension

For this scenario, you need to create two groups: one removable storage
group for any removable storage and another group for unallowed file
extensions. You also need to create one policy - deny read and execute
access to any file under the allowed file extension group for defined
removable storage group.

[arabic]
. Create groups
[arabic]
.. Group 1: Any removable storage, CD/DVD, and Windows portable devices.
.. Group 2: Unallowed file extensions.

What does `40' mean in the policy? It’s 8 + 32 = 40:
* only need to restrict file system level access

Although this case only has one policy, make sure put it under
