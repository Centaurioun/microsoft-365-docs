Security is recognized as a key component in running an enterprise,
however some organizations might not have the capacity or expertise to
have a dedicated security operations team to manage the security of
their endpoints and network, others may want to have a second set of
eyes to review alerts in their network.

To address this demand, managed security service providers (MSSP) offer
to deliver managed detection and response (MDR) services on top of
Defender for Endpoint.

Defender for Endpoint adds partnership opportunities for this scenario
and allows MSSPs to take the following actions:

* Get access to MSSP customerâ€™s Microsoft 365 Defender portal
* Get email notifications, and
* Fetch alerts through security information and event management (SIEM)
tools
