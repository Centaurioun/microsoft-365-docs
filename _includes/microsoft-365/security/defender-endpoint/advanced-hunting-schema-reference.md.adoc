The xref:advanced-hunting-overview.adoc[advanced hunting] schema is made up of multiple tables that provide either event information or information about devices and other entities.
To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to understand the tables and the columns in the advanced hunting schema.

=== Get schema information in the Defender for Cloud

While constructing queries, use the built-in schema reference to quickly get the following information about each table in the schema:

* *Tables description*: Type of data contained in the table and the source of that data.
* *Columns*: All the columns in the table.
* *Action types*: Possible values in the `ActionType` column representing the event types supported by the table.
These values are provided only for tables that contain event information.
* *Sample query*: Example queries that feature how the table can be utilized.

==== Access the schema reference

To quickly access the schema reference, select the *View reference* action next to the table name in the schema representation.
You can also select *Schema reference* to search for a table.

The following reference lists all the tables in the advanced hunting schema.
Each table name links to a page describing the column names for that table.
