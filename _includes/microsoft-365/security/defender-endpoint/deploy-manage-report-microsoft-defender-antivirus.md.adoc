== Deploy, manage, and report on Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Applies to:*

* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1]
* https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2]
* Microsoft Defender Antivirus

*Platforms*

* Windows

You can deploy, manage, and report on Microsoft Defender Antivirus in many ways.

Because the Microsoft Defender Antivirus client is installed as a core part of Windows 10 and Windows 11, traditional deployment of a client to your endpoints doesn't apply.

However, in most cases you'll still need to enable the protection service on your endpoints with Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, or Group Policy Objects, which is described in the following table.

You'll also see other links for:

* Managing Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection, including managing product and protection updates
* Reporting on Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection

____
[!IMPORTANT] In most cases, Windows 10 or Windows 11 will disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus if it finds another antivirus product that is running and up-to-date.
You must disable or uninstall third-party antivirus products before Microsoft Defender Antivirus will function.
If you re-enable or install third-party antivirus products, then Windows 10 or Windows 11 automatically disables Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

. The availability of some functions and features, especially related to cloud-delivered protection, differ between Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Current Branch) and System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.
In this library, we've focused on Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Current Branch).
See xref:cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Use Microsoft cloud-provided protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus] for a table that describes the major differences.
<<ref2,(Return to table)>>
. In Windows 10 and Windows 11, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a component available without installation or deployment of another client or service.
It will automatically be enabled when third-party antivirus products are either uninstalled or out of date (except on Windows Server 2016).
Traditional deployment, therefore, isn't required.
Deployment here refers to ensuring the Microsoft Defender Antivirus component is available and enabled on endpoints or servers.

. Configuration of features and protection, including configuring product and protection updates, are further described in the xref:configure-notifications-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus features] section in this library.

| xref:deploy-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Deploy and enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection]
| While the client is installed as a core part of Windows 10 or Windows 11, and traditional deployment doesn't apply, you'll still need to enable the client on your endpoints with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, or Group Policy Objects.

| xref:manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines]
| There are two parts to updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus: updating the client on endpoints (product updates), and updating Security intelligence (protection updates).
You can update Security intelligence in many ways, using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Group Policy, PowerShell, and WMI.

| xref:report-monitor-microsoft-defender-antivirus.adoc[Monitor and report on Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection]
| You can use Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, the Update Compliance add-in for Microsoft Operations Management Suite, or a third-party SIEM product (by consuming Windows event logs) to monitor protection status and create reports about endpoint protection.
