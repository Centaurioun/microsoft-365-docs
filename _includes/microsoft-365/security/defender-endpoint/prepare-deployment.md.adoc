| Server count
| Total count of Servers by operating system version.

| Management engine
| Management engine name and version (for example, System Center Configuration Manager Current Branch 1803).

| CDOC distribution

=== Role-based access control

Microsoft recommends using the concept of least privileges.
Defender for Endpoint leverages built-in roles within Azure Active Directory.
Microsoft recommends link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference[review the different roles that are available] and choose the right one to solve your needs for each persona for this application.
Some roles may need to be applied temporarily and removed after the deployment has been completed.

Microsoft recommends using link:/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure[Privileged Identity Management] to manage your roles to provide additional auditing, control, and access review for users with directory permissions.

Defender for Endpoint supports two ways to manage permissions:

* *Basic permissions management*: Set permissions to either full access or read-only.
Users with Global Administrator or Security Administrator roles in Azure Active Directory have full access.
The Security reader role has read-only access and does not grant access to view machines/device inventory.
* *Role-based access control (RBAC)*: Set granular permissions by defining roles, assigning Azure AD user groups to the roles, and granting the user groups access to device groups.
For more information.
see xref:rbac.adoc[Manage portal access using role-based access control].

Microsoft recommends leveraging RBAC to ensure that only users that have a business justification can access Defender for Endpoint.

You can find details on permission guidelines here: link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/user-roles#create-roles-and-assign-the-role-to-an-azure-active-directory-group[Create roles and assign the role to an Azure Active Directory group].

The following example table serves to identify the Cyber Defense Operations Center structure in your environment that will help you determine the RBAC structure required for your environment.

|===
| Tier | Description | Permission Required

| Tier 1
| *Local security operations team / IT team* <p> This team usually triages and investigates alerts contained within their geolocation and escalates to Tier 2 in cases where an active remediation is required.

| Tier 2
| *Regional security operations team* <p> This team can see all the devices for their region and perform remediation actions.

| Tier 3
| *Global security operations team* <p> This team consists of security experts and is authorized to see and perform all actions from the portal.

=== Adoption Order

In many cases, organizations will have existing endpoint security products in place.
The bare minimum every organization should have been an antivirus solution.
But in some cases, an organization might also have implanted an EDR solution already.

Historically, replacing any security solution used to be time intensive and difficult to achieve due to the tight hooks into the application layer and infrastructure dependencies.
However, because Defender for Endpoint is built into the operating system, replacing third-party solutions is now easy to achieve.

Choose the component of Defender for Endpoint to be used and remove the ones that do not apply.
The table below indicates the order Microsoft recommends for how the endpoint security suite should be enabled.

| 4

| Auto Investigation & Remediation (AIR)
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses Automated investigations to significantly reduce the volume of alerts that need to be investigated individually.
The Automated investigation feature leverages various inspection algorithms, and processes used by analysts (such as playbooks) to examine alerts and take immediate remediation action to resolve breaches.
This significantly reduces alert volume, allowing security operations experts to focus on more sophisticated threats and other high value initiatives.
