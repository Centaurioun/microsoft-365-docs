You are currently in the preparation phase.

Preparation is key to any successful deployment. In this article, you’ll
be guided on the points you’ll need to consider as you prepare to deploy
Defender for Endpoint.

=== Stakeholders and approval

the stakeholders, which will help identify potential dependencies and/or
changes required in technologies or processes.

=== Role-based access control

Microsoft recommends using the concept of least privileges. Defender for
Endpoint leverages built-in roles within Azure Active Directory.
Microsoft recommends
link:/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference[review the
different roles that are available] and choose the right one to solve
your needs for each persona for this application. Some roles may need to
be applied temporarily and removed after the deployment has been
completed.

|Security Administrator | | |

|Business Owner/Stakeholder | | |
| | | |
|===

Microsoft recommends using
link:/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure[Privileged
Identity Management] to manage your roles to provide additional
auditing, control, and access review for users with directory
permissions.

Defender for Endpoint supports two ways to manage permissions:

* *Basic permissions management*: Set permissions to either full access
or read-only. Users with Global Administrator or Security Administrator
roles in Azure Active Directory have full access. The Security reader
role has read-only access and does not grant access to view
machines/device inventory.
* *Role-based access control (RBAC)*: Set granular permissions by
defining roles, assigning Azure AD user groups to the roles, and
granting the user groups access to device groups. For more information.
see link:rbac.md[Manage portal access using role-based access control].

Microsoft recommends leveraging RBAC to ensure that only users that have
a business justification can access Defender for Endpoint.

You can find details on permission guidelines here:
link:/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/user-roles#create-roles-and-assign-the-role-to-an-azure-active-directory-group[Create
roles and assign the role to an Azure Active Directory group].

The following example table serves to identify the Cyber Defense
Operations Center structure in your environment that will help you
determine the RBAC structure required for your environment.

=== Adoption Order

In many cases, organizations will have existing endpoint security
products in place. The bare minimum every organization should have been
an antivirus solution. But in some cases, an organization might also
have implanted an EDR solution already.

Historically, replacing any security solution used to be time intensive
and difficult to achieve due to the tight hooks into the application
layer and infrastructure dependencies. However, because Defender for
Endpoint is built into the operating system, replacing third-party
solutions is now easy to achieve.

Choose the component of Defender for Endpoint to be used and remove the
ones that do not apply. The table below indicates the order Microsoft
recommends for how the endpoint security suite should be enabled.

|Component |Description |Adoption Order Rank
|Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) |Defender for Endpoint endpoint
detection and response capabilities provide advanced attack detections
that are near real-time and actionable. Security analysts can prioritize
alerts effectively, gain visibility into the full scope of a breach, and
take response actions to remediate threats. |1

Vulnerability Management is a component of Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint, and provides both security administrators and security
operations teams with unique value, including: |2

|Next-generation protection (NGP) |Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a
built-in antimalware solution that provides next-generation protection
for desktops, portable computers, and servers. Microsoft Defender
Antivirus includes: |3

|Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) |Attack surface reduction capabilities
in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint help protect the devices and
applications in the organization from new and emerging threats.

|Auto Investigation & Remediation (AIR) |Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
uses Automated investigations to significantly reduce the volume of
alerts that need to be investigated individually. The Automated
investigation feature leverages various inspection algorithms, and
processes used by analysts (such as playbooks) to examine alerts and
take immediate remediation action to resolve breaches. This
significantly reduces alert volume, allowing security operations experts
to focus on more sophisticated threats and other high value initiatives.

hunting service that provides Security Operation Centers (SOCs) with
expert level monitoring and analysis to help them ensure that critical
threats in their unique environments don’t get missed. |Not applicable
