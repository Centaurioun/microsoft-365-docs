Investigate the details of a file associated with a specific alert,
behavior, or event to help determine if the file exhibits malicious
activities, identify the attack motivation, and understand the potential
scope of the breach.

There are many ways to access the detailed profile page of a specific
file. For example, you can use the search feature, click on a link from
the *Alert process tree*, *Incident graph*, *Artifact timeline*, or
select an event listed in the *Device timeline*.

Once on the detailed profile page, you can switch between the new and
old page layouts by toggling *new File page*. The rest of this article
describes the newer page layout.

You can get information from the following sections in the file view:

* File details, Malware detection, File prevalence
* File PE metadata (if it exists)
* Alerts
* Observed in organization
* Deep analysis
* File names
* Action center

You can also take action on a file from this page.

=== File actions

Along the top of the profile page, above the file information cards.
Actions you can perform here include:

* Stop and quarantine
* Add/edit indicator
* Download file
* Consult a threat expert
* Manual actions

For more information on these actions, see
link:respond-file-alerts.md[Take response action on a file].

=== File details, Malware detection, and File prevalence

The file details, incident, malware detection, and file prevalence cards
display various attributes about the file.

You’ll see details such as the file’s MD5, the Virus Total detection
ratio, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus detection if available, and the
file’s prevalence.

The file prevalence card shows where the file was seen in devices in the
organization and worldwide. You can easily pivot to the first and last
devices where the file was seen on, and continue the investigation in
the device timeline.

____
[!NOTE] Different users may see dissimilar values in the _devices in
organization_ section of the file prevalence card. This is because the
card displays information based on the RBAC scope that a user has.
Meaning, if a user has been granted visibility on a specific set of
devices, they will only see the file organizational prevalence on those
devices.

showing file prevalence.]

=== Incidents and alerts

The *Incidents and alerts* tab provides a list of incidents that are
associated with the file, as well as the alerts the file is linked to.
This list covers much of the same information as the incidents queue.
You can choose what kind of information is shown by selecting *Customize
columns* from the toolbar above the column headers.

showing incidents and alerts.]

=== Observed in organization

The *Observed in organization* tab allows you to specify a date range to
see which devices have been observed with the file.

____
[!NOTE] This tab will show a maximum number of 100 devices. To see _all_
devices with the file, export the tab to a CSV file, by selecting
*Export* from the action menu above the tab’s column headers.

Use the slider or the range selector to quickly specify a time period
that you want to check for events involving the file. You can get
assisted by the alerts indication over the range. You can specify a time
window as small as a single day. This will allow you to see only files
that communicated with that IP Address at that time, drastically
reducing unnecessary scrolling and searching.

=== Deep analysis

The *Deep analysis* tab allows you to
link:respond-file-alerts.md#deep-analysis[submit the file for deep
analysis], to uncover more details about the file’s behavior, as well as
the effect it is having within your organizations. After you submit the
file, the deep analysis report will appear in this tab once results are
available. If deep analysis did not find anything, the report will be
empty and the results space will remain blank.

=== File names

The *File names* tab lists all names the file has been observed to use,
within your organizations.

:::image type=``content'' source=``images/atp-file-names.png''
alt-text=``The File names tab''
lightbox=``images/atp-file-names.png'':::

=== Action center

The *Action center* displays the action center filtered on a specific
file, so you can see pending actions and the history of actions taken on
the file.
