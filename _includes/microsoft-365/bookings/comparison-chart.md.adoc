== Comparison chart: Bookings web app vs. Bookings Teams app

The Bookings app in Teams lets schedulers handle their main tasks and change some settings.
However, the Bookings web includes advanced features and settings that are not yet available in the Teams app.

Teams app features are being added all the time and we will continue to update this list.
See the *Is all the functionality of the original Bookings Web app available in Microsoft Teams?* section in the link:bookings-faq.yml[FAQ] for more details.
