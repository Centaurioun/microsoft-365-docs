== Schedule Bookings business closures, time off, and vacation time

Occasionally, you’ll want to close your business for holidays or team
events, or your employees will need time off when they’re sick, on
vacation, or unavailable for other reasons. You can schedule time off
from the Microsoft Bookings calendar, and the employee will be
unavailable for bookings during the specified time. Once the business
reopens or employees return to work, everyone will be listed on the
booking page according to their established work hours.
