== Create a manual booking

Bookings can be scheduled and staffed in two different ways. The first
way is by the customer using a standalone booking page or an embedded
booking page that you add to your website. The other way is for you or
one of your employees to enter the bookings manually, such as when a
customer calls for an appointment. This article covers the manual
scenario.

. Enter the service details, including date, time, location, and other
relevant information. Once you enter a valid email address for the
customer, you’ll see a note telling you that a confirmation will be sent
to the customer. The customer confirmation includes an attachment for
them to add to their calendar. Selected staff members will also receive
meeting invitations with the appointment information so they can add it
to their personal calendars.
. Select *Add an email reminder*.
. Specify when the reminder should be sent, where it should be sent
(*Customer*, *Staff*, *All attendees*), and what the reminder message
should be.
. Select *Create booking*.

Here’s an example email of the reminder your customer will receive:
