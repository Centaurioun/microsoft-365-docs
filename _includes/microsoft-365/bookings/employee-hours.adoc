== Employee working hours in Microsoft Bookings

Setting employee working hours ensures that their availability is
accurately shown when your customers try to book them. By default, the
working hours for each of your employees match the business hours you’ve
established in the Microsoft Bookings app. See the ``Set your business
hours'' section of link:enter-business-information.md[Enter business
information].

On the *Staff* page, you can customize employee working hours to match
the needs of your business and employees.

If you want to book time off for staff members so customers can’t book
them while they’re out of the office, see
link:schedule-closures-time-off-vacation.md[Schedule business closures&#44;
time off&#44; and vacation time] for instructions.
