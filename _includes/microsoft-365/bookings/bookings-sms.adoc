== Configure SMS text notifications and reminders in Microsoft Bookings

With Microsoft Bookings, you can set up SMS text notifications to be
sent to the person booking an appointment. You can set up SMS
notifications in Bookings in the Bookings web app or Bookings app in
Teams. Attendees, customers or partners can also opt in or out of
getting SMS notifications on the self-serve booking page. They can also
opt out of receiving SMS notifications by replying *STOP* to the sender.

The SMS notifications will include the Teams meeting link for virtual
booking appointments.
