== Search for users in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse lets you search for a specific user across all active tenants.
This allows you to find a user quickly without needing to navigate different tenants.

. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select *Users* > *Account management* > *Search users*.
. In the search box, enter a display name or user principal name (UPN).
. From the search results list, select the user you want to research.

=== Next steps

Once the user is found, you can reset their password or block their account.
