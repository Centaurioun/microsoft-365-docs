== Manage your tenant list in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

To help you manage your tenant list in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, you can apply custom tags to your tenants.
These tags can be used to organize your tenants and can also help you filter the existing views and insights available to relevant sets of tenants.
You can manage your tags from the Tenants page.
Once created and assigned, you can filter the data within the Tenants, Users, Devices, Threat management, and Windows 365 pages based on a tag.

=== Before you begin

To manage tenant tags, you must:

* Meet the xref:m365-lighthouse-requirements.adoc[requirements for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse].

* Complete the processes outlined in the xref:m365-lighthouse-configure-portal-security.adoc[Configure Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal security] article.
* Be a Global Administrator of the partner tenant.
