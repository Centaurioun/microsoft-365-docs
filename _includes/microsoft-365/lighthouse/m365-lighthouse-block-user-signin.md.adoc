== Block user sign-in in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

You can block a user account if you think it's compromised.
When you block a user account, it immediately blocks anyone from signing in to that account.
If a user tries to sign in, they're automatically signed out of all Microsoft 365 services within 60 minutes.
Blocking a user account won't delete any data, and it won't stop the account from receiving mail.

=== Block sign-in for a user

. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select *Users* > *Account management* >**Search users**.
. On the *Search users* tab, enter a user's name in the search box.
. From the search results list, select the user.
. In the user details pane, select *Block sign-in*.
. In the *Block sign-in* pane, select *Block this user from signing in*.
. Select *Save changes*.

=== Block sign-in for risky users

. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select *Users* > *Risky users*.
. On the *Risky Users* page, select the set of users you want to take action on.
. Select *Block sign-in*.
. In the *Manage sign-in status* pane, select *Block users from signing in*.
. Select *Save*.
