== View an enterprise Cloud PC failed network connection in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides the connection status between your customer tenants and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
When a Cloud PC has a failed network connection, you can view detailed information in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

=== Before you begin

* You must be a Global Administrator in the partner tenant.
* You must have Cloud PC Administrator or Cloud PC Reader access to view connection issues.

=== View a failed network connection

. In the left navigation pane in Lighthouse, select *Devices* > *Windows 365*.
. Select the *Azure network connections* tab.
. From the colored count-annotation bar, select *Failed connections*.
. From the filtered list, select *View connection details in Microsoft Endpoint Manager* next to the connection you want to investigate.
. From the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select *View details* to learn more about the error.
