# Appointments with Microsoft Teams

With Bookings in Microsoft Teams, you have a complete platform to schedule, manage, and conduct business-to-customer engagements. For example:

- Financial advisors, claims adjusters, and other financial professionals can meet with clients remotely.
- Sales associates, product experts, and design consultants can conduct virtual fittings and consultations.
- Clinicians can meet with patients or other healthcare providers to discuss medical care.
- Human resources departments can conduct virtual interviews with job candidates.

- [Bookings](#bookings), for every organization

## Bookings

Use Bookings for all your appointment needs. The app enables a seamless end-to-end experience for business-to-customer engagements, integrating schedules, analytics, and management options, all in one place.

You can schedule, view, and manage appointments, get real-time status updates in a queue view, send appointment reminders, configure calendar, staff, and booking page settings.

In Bookings, you can use basic capabilities that make it easy to schedule and join business-to-customer meetings. For example, you can schedule appointments in the Bookings calendar and external attendees can [join through a browser](browser-join.md) without having to download Teams. [Teams Premium](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams) unlocks advanced Bookings and virtual appointments capabilities that your organization can use to manage and customize the experience. These include a queue view of scheduled and on-demand appointments, SMS text notifications, custom waiting rooms through meeting themes, and usage reports for admins.

To learn more, see [Microsoft Bookings](/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-overview).

## Teams Electronic Health Record (EHR) connector

If your healthcare organization uses an EHR system, you can use the Teams EHR connector to integrate Teams for a more seamless virtual care experience. The Teams EHR connector requires an active subscription to Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare or a subscription to Microsoft Teams EHR connector standalone offer.

After you set up the Teams EHR connector, clinicians can launch visits with patients and consultations with other providers in Teams directly from the EHR system.

Currently, the Teams EHR connector supports integration with the Oracle Health EHR system and Epic EHR system. To learn more, see:

- [Virtual Appointments with Teams - Integration into Oracle Health EHR](ehr-admin-oracle-health.md)
- [Virtual Appointments with Teams - Integration into Epic EHR](ehr-admin-epic.md)

## Virtual appointment meeting template

The virtual appointment template is a default meeting template in Teams that your users can use to schedule virtual appointments with external guests, such as customers, clients, and other people outside your organization.

To learn more, see [Manage the Virtual appointment meeting template in Teams](/microsoftteams/virtual-appointment-meeting-template).

## Virtual appointment Graph API

With the virtual appointment Graph API, virtual appointment join links can be embedded in any app, with features that include a waiting room and browser join experience for external attendees.

To learn more, see [virtualAppointment: getVirtualAppointmentJoinWebUrl](/graph/api/virtualappointment-getvirtualappointmentjoinweburl).
