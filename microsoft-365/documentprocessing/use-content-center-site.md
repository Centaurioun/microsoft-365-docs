# Use the content center site template

> [!NOTE]
> The content center site template is provided in the SharePoint look book service, which is no longer being updated. Some of the information in this template might not reflect the current features.

The content center site is a ready-to-deploy instructional SharePoint site template designed to help you better understand document processing capabilities.

You are introduced to the tools and information you need to create and train your own models. You'll then be able to use this site as a central content repository or as the control center for managing your own document processing models.

In this site, models can be trained and evaluated using your own content. However, to apply the models to libraries, a pay-as-you-go license is required.  

## Provision the site

The content center site can be provisioned from the SharePoint look book service.

![Screenshot of the content center site template provisioning page.](../media/content-understanding/content-center-site-provisioning-page.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a [SharePoint Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) or [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) to provision the site.

[!INCLUDE [global-administrator-note](../includes/global-administrator-note.md)]

1. From the main page of the SharePoint look book, on the **View the designs** menu, select **Syntex** > **Syntex content center**.
