# Licensing for document processing for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 offers flexible, scalable document processing services through a pay-as-you-go licensing model. This model is ideal for organizations seeking agility without upfront commitments.

> [!NOTE]
> For Government Community Cloud (GCC) organizations, pay-as-you-go licensing—and the services that require pay-as-you-go licensing—aren't yet available. GCC organizations can continue to purchase and use [per-user licenses](#if-you-still-have-active-per-user-licenses) until pay-as-you-go becomes available.

## Benefits of pay-as-you-go licensing

- **No upfront license purchase**: Use services as needed—only pay when services are used. Learn more about [pay-as-you-go pricing](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md).

- **Organization-wide access**: Any user in your tenant can use the services, provided they have a Microsoft 365 license.

- **Azure-based billing**: Use your active Azure subscription for billing. Learn more about [setting up billing](/microsoft-365/services/pay-as-you-go-setup) and the [terms of service](/legal/microsoft-365/microsoft-syntex-pay-as-you-go-terms).

## Document processing services

The following pay-as-you-go services are currently available for document processing:

- [Autofill columns](autofill-overview.md)
- [Document translation](translation-overview.md)
- [eSignature](esignature-overview.md)
- [Optical character recognition](ocr-overview.md)
- [Content assembly](content-assembly.md)
- [Image tagging](image-tagging-overview.md)

### Included features

The following content management features are available (at no cost) once you set up a pay-as-you-go service:

- [Content query](metadata-search.md)
- [Annotations](annotations.md)
- [Content processing rules](content-processing-overview.md)
- [Solution accelerators](site-templates.md)
- [Taxonomy tools](import-term-set-skos.md)

## If you still have active per-user licenses

Per-user licenses for these services are no longer available for purchase. However:

- Existing licenses can still be assigned to new users.
- Once expired, you must switch to [pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md) to continue using services.

If you still have an active per-user license, you can continue to:

- Apply unstructured models to libraries.
- Create prebuilt, structured, and freeform models.
- Upload content to libraries with applied models.
- Run models on demand.
- Use content assembly and taxonomy services.
- Use content query and annotations.
- Use document library rules for automation.

For structured or freeform models in a custom Power Platform environment, see [Set up a custom Power Platform environment](structured-freeform-setup.md#set-up-a-custom-power-platform-environment).
