# Understand opportunities and data in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse uses machine learning (ML) models to recommend growth, retention, and acquisition opportunities&mdash;and provides reasons for the recommendations&mdash;to help drive ongoing conversations with your customers throughout the entire customer lifecycle. The data used in the ML models combines insights about each customer, current subscriptions, and usage and engagement metrics for each product they use. Opportunities are displayed on the **Opportunities** page in Lighthouse (formerly under **Sales Advisor**). 

## Opportunities page

The **Opportunities** page includes an **All opportunities** tab that provides an overview of opportunities across all your customers. It includes a total count of opportunities at the top of the tab, and a total count of opportunities filtered by product. The tab also includes a list of opportunities for each customer. 

Each opportunity in the list contains the following information:

- **Tenant:** Name of the customer tenant. Select any tenant in the list to view recommendation details, insights, suggested actions, resources, subscriptions, and usage data for the customer. 

- **Recommendation:** Recommended action for the opportunity. 

- **Probability:** Likelihood that a prediction is correct. Probability values are **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**. 

- **Product:** Product associated with the opportunity (not visible for Retention opportunities). 

- **Opportunity type:** General category of the opportunity: **Upsell**, **Engagement**, **Retention**, **Expansion**, or **Trial**.

- **Total licenses:** Number of paid licenses in the customer tenant. 

- **Date created:** Date the opportunity was first created for the customer. Recommendations are refreshed regularly to capture the most recent customer signals. If there's no change to the customer signals, the opportunity remains, regardless of when it was first created.

> [!NOTE]
> Each customer can have zero, one, or more opportunities. Only customers with one or more opportunities are shown in the opportunities list.

All tabs on the **Opportunities** page include the following options: 

- **Export:** Select to export opportunities data to an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file. 
- **Search**: Enter keywords to quickly locate something specific in the opportunities list.
