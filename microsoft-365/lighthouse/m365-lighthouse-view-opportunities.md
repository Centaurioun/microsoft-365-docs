# View opportunities in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Opportunities in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse (formerly under **Sales Advisor**) provide actionable recommendations generated by machine learning (ML) models to help you manage your customers and grow your business. Each customer can have zero, one, or more opportunities. Only customers with one or more opportunities are shown in the list on the **Opportunities** page.

To learn more about opportunities, see [Understand opportunities and data in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-understanding-opportunities-and-data.md).

## Before you begin

To view opportunities, you must hold the Account Manager role in Lighthouse. If you don't hold the Account Manager role, reach out to someone who holds the Administrator role in Lighthouse and ask them to assign the role to you. For more information, see [Overview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview-of-permissions.md).

## View opportunities

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Opportunities**.

2. On the **All opportunities** tab, select the tenant whose opportunities you want to view.

3. In the tenant details pane, review the **Recommendations**, **Subscriptions**, and **Usage** tabs for specific tenant details and suggested actions.
 
    The following table describes the information on each tab.   

|Tab      |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Recommendations     |  Includes the following information:<br>**Customer insights**: Characteristics of the selected customer based on historical data and correlation. Explains why Lighthouse suggests the specific recommendation.<br>**Suggested actions**: Specific suggestions for how to act on the recommendation (such as running a workshop).<br>**Related resources**: Materials such as playbooks, demos, cheat sheets, and email templates to help you prepare for conversations with your customer regarding the opportunity.       |
|Subscriptions     | Information about the products purchased by the customer from your organization or from Microsoft directly, including product name, purchase quantity, and subscription status (Active/Inactive).         |
|Usage     | Information about how users use Microsoft 365 services for all products the customer owns. Includes a usage-per-user graph that you can filter by Microsoft 365 service. The tab also includes a table with the following information:<br>**Workload**: Product or service.<br>**Assigned users**: Number of licensed users assigned to a product or service.<br>**Active users**: Number of users actively using the workload.<br>**Trend**: Monthly active usage over the previous three months: No change, Positive, or Negative.        |

## View opportunities by opportunity type

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Opportunities**.
2. Use the **Opportunity type** filter to select the opportunity type you want to filter the opportunities list by.

For more information about opportunity types, see [Understand opportunities and data in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-understanding-opportunities-and-data.md#opportunity-type).

## Export opportunities

Lighthouse can export opportunities data into an Excel comma-separated values (.csv) file that you can integrate into your internal tools to create custom reports. If you apply filters to the list of opportunities, the exported data reflects the filtered view. 

1. In the left navigation pane in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2168110" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, select **Opportunities**.
2. Select the tab with the list of opportunities you want to export (**All opportunities**, **Customer acquisition**, **Customer retention**, or **Customer growth**).
3. Filter the list of opportunities as needed by using the filters (**Group**, **Probability**, **Product**, **Opportunity type**, or **Date created**).
4. Select **Export**.

The downloaded file contains the following data:

- Customer ID
- TPID
- Customer Name
- Opportunity Type
- Customer Insight
- Suggested Actions
- Related Resources
- Growth Propensity
- Recommended Product
- Seats
- Date added
- Link (a unique URL for each opportunity)
