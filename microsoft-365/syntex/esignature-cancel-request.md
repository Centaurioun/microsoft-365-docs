# Cancel a signature request from PDF or Word in SharePoint eSignature

If you create a signature request and want to cancel it, follow these steps.

1. From one of your email notifications, select **View Request**.

2. When the document is open in the document viewer, select **More options** (...), and then select **Cancel request**.

    Once canceled, the status of the request is set to **Canceled** and recipients receive an email notification telling them that the request was canceled and that no further action is possible on this request.
