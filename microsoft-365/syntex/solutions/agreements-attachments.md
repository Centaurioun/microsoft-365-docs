# Manage attachments in SharePoint Agreements

Attachments are files related to the agreement and are also commonly referred to as supporting documents. Typically attachments might be meeting minutes, financial documents, emails, or other types that contribute the agreement package.

## Add an attachment

You can add one or more attachments to an existing agreement by uploading files using the agreements viewer dialog in the SharePoint Agreements app.

To add an attachment, follow these steps:

1. From the Agreements app in Microsoft Teams, on the **Home** tab, select the **Agreements** tab.

2. From the **Agreements** tab, select the agreement to which you wish to add an attachment.

3. With the agreement viewer panel now open, select **Attachments** from the **Details** dropdown.

4. From the **Attachments** panel, select **Add attachments** to open the file picker.

5. Browse to the location of the attachment, and then choose one or more files to attach to the agreement.

6. Select **Open** to upload the files and view them as attachments in the viewer panel.

7. On the Agreements list page in the Agreements Teams app, agreements with attachments have an attachment icon with the attachment count displayed next to the file name.

> [!NOTE]
> The supported file types for attachments are Adobe .pdf, Microsoft Office files including Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and email files in Outlook or Gmail format. Attempting to add unsupported files results in an error.<br><br>
> When you add a file to an attachment, only one instance of the same file can be attached. Duplicates generate a warning.<br><br>
> Attachments added to an agreement have the same access permissions as the agreement to which they're attached.
> Attachments can be added to an agreement in any state, before or after they have been signed.
