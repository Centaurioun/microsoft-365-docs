# Manage amendments in SharePoint Agreements

Amendments are documents added to signed, active agreements which modify the original parent agreement. Amendments can be used to alter content or field values of the signed agreement, including updating contact owners, changing payment terms, adding additional clauses, or extending the duration of the agreement. Users can amend an agreement by uploading a signed amendment pdf to the original agreement. 

On the Agreements list page in the Agreements Teams app, agreements with amendments will have a populated Amended column with its most recent amendment effective date. Additionally, in the Details pane, field values that have been altered by amendments will have a tooltip indicator containing the effective date of the amendment that has altered them.
