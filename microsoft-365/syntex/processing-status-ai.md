# Monitor the status of files processed for autofill and translation in SharePoint

<sup>**Applies to:**  &ensp; &#10003; Autofill columns &ensp; | &ensp; &#10003; Document translation</sup>

> [!NOTE]
> This article is currently in development.

Gain full visibility into your file processing workflows with real-time updates on autofill columns and document translation. This feature provides continuous status tracking for each file, allowing you to monitor progress, identify issues early, and take action as needed.

Designed to address common challenges such as limited transparency, insufficient detail, and administrative uncertainties, this enhancement replaces the traditional single-status column with a more granular view. You can now see which services have succeeded, failed, or are still in progressâ€”along with detailed error messages and direct links to relevant documentation.

## Monitor file processing activity

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your SharePoint library has the [autofill columns service](autofill-overview.md) or the [document translation service](translation-overview.md) enabled.

- Ensure you have permission to view or manage the library.

### View status for a single file

1. elect a file in your SharePoint document library.

2. Select the **Status Pane** entry point (usually in the command bar or file context menu).

3. The pane shows:
   - File name
   - A timeline of processing events (grouped by Today, Last week, and so on)
   - Each service that ran (for example, autofill columns or document translation)
   - Status: In progress, Completed, or Failed
   - Timestamp of the last update

4. If a process failed, select the status to view:
   - The failure reason (for example, "File encrypted" or "Unsupported format")
   - Suggested actions
   - A link to troubleshooting documentation (if available)

5. Use filters to show only failed statuses for easier triage.

### Monitor statuses across the library

1. Without selecting a file, open the **Status Pane** from the library view.

2. The pane shows:
   - A chronological list of all file processing events
   - File name, service name, status, and timestamp
   - Grouped by time (Today, Last Week, etc.)

3. Use the **graphical summary** at the top to see:
   - Number of files per status (In progress, Completed, or Failed)
   - Select any status count to drill into the relevant files

4. Apply filters to focus on failed jobs or specific services.

### Status definitions

| Status       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In progress  | The service has started processing the file. Timestamp is shown.           |
| Completed    | The service finished successfully. Might include extracted metadata or translated files. |
| Failed       | The service encountered an error. Select to view the reason and resolution. |
