# Privacy, security, and compliance in document processing for Microsoft 365

Microsoft is transparent about the specific policies, operational practices, and technologies that help you ensure the privacy, security, and compliance of your data across document processing pay-as-you-go services.

- Microsoft respects the privacy and ownership of data you use to train and process document processing models.

- None of your organization's data is used or transferred by Microsoft to train AI models, large-language models, or any other models.

- Your data remains securely within your organization’s tenant.

## Privacy

Privacy is built into all document processing experiences. Pay-as-you-go services adhere to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and follow Microsoft's compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) and the [Microsoft EU Data Boundary](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb).

Document processing services inherit privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.

### GDPR compliance

Document processing services support compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) (GDPR) requirements.

### Data residency

Data residency refers to the geographic location where data is stored at rest. The way that data is transferred and stored for document processing services is defined in the [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) (DPA).

All data within document processing services is stored within the customer tenant for any given service and follows the standard Microsoft 365 data storage guidelines by available geography.

## Security

Document processing services works with and integrates into Microsoft 365. This means that the Microsoft 365 security capabilities—such role-based access, identity and app management, and others—apply to the services.

## Compliance

Microsoft offers a [comprehensive set of compliance offerings](/compliance) to help your organization comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use and data.

Document processing services are also covered under the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Product-Terms) and [Data Protection Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA?year=2021#:%7E:text=Microsoft%20Products%20and%20Services%20Data%20Protection%20Addendum%20%28DPA%29,to%20the%20Product%20Terms%20site%20%28and%20formerly%20OST%29) (DPA).
