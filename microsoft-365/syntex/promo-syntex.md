# Try out pay-as-you-go services for document processing

Document processing for Microsoft 365 provides powerful content management and productivity services that let you do more with your documents. You can process, analyze, create, sign, manage, and enhance them with ease.

Through December 2025, your organization can use [included monthly capacity](#included-monthly-capacity) for some of these services when you set up [pay-as-you-go billing](syntex-azure-billing.md). It's a great way to try out document processing capabilities, such as autofill columns, document translation, electronic signatures, and optical character recognition, to see how you can use them to streamline processes in your organization.

## Get started

If you want to try some of these services, here are the steps to follow:

1. [Set up pay-as-you-go billing](/microsoft-365/services/pay-as-you-go-setup).

2. [Turn on the document processing services you want to try](set-up-microsoft-syntex.md).

3. [Start using the document processing services](syntex-overview.md#document-processing-services).

## Included monthly capacity

You'll get a limited amount of usage each month during the offering period. The following table shows the units of service and capacity limits your organization can use at no charge for each month. Capacity limits shown are per tenant, not per user.

|Service  |Units  |Monthly included capacity at no charge  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Autofill columns                 | Pages        | 100*       |
|Content assembly                 | Documents    | 50         |
|Document translation             | Characters   | 1 million  |
|eSignature                       | Requests     | 5          |
|Image tagging                    | Images       | 2,500      |
|Optical character recognition    | Pages        | 2,500      |
|Prebuilt document processing     | Pages        | 100        |
|Structured document processing   | Pages        | 100        |
|Taxonomy tagging                 | Documents    | 50         |
|Unstructured document processing | Pages        | 100*       |

<sup>*The monthly included capacity for autofill columns is shared with unstructured document processing for a total of 100 pages.</sup>

Monthly usage over the limitations will be billed as described in [Pay-as-you-go services and pricing](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md). This offering doesn't include capacity for Microsoft 365 Archive and Microsoft 365 Backup.
