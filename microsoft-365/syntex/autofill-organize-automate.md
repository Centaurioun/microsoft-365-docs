# Organize and automate columns in a SharePoint document library

> [!NOTE]
> This article is in development.

<!---
Having useful columns and metadata in SharePoint document libraries enhances searchability, organization, and automation. It allows users to quickly find documents, group and filter files dynamically, and trigger workflows based on specific attributes. Additionally, it improves content discoverability and user experience by providing structured information and enabling efficient management of document libraries.
--->

This feature integrates with the autofill columns service to streamline your workflows using content from your SharePoint document libraries. It recommends and creates new columns and metadata, unlocks advanced automations, and enhances search capabilities, understanding, and information protection. This helps ensure that the information in your document libraries remains easily accessible, relevant, well-organized, and up-to-date.

## Suggest and create columns

To get suggested columns in your document library, follow these steps.

1. In the lower-right corner of your document library, select the **FAB-name** icon.

2. From the list of actions, select **Organize this library** to launch the process.

3. Up to five new columns are suggested based on the content of the library. Suggested columns are indicated by a light bulb icon and a blue highlight. Evaluate whether the suggested columns are appropriate for your content.

4. The new columns are populated with metadata. Evaluate whether the metadata is appropriate for your content.

5. The metadata is based on suggested prompts. To edit or refine a prompt, select **Edit column**. On the **Edit column** panel, under **Prompt**, refresh the prompt to try other suggested prompts. You can also edit and reapply the prompt.

6. To remove a suggested column, in the column heading, select **Remove**. You can also remove or add a column by using the column options menu.
