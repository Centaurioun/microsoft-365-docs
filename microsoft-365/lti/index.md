description: Learn about Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) Microsoft apps, and how they help educators when integrating Microsoft apps into their Learning Management System (LMS).

# Integrating Microsoft products with your Learning Management System (LMS)

The Microsoft 365 LTI app brings Microsoft 365 Education experiences like Microsoft Assignments, OneDrive/Microsoft 365 files, Teams for collaboration, Teams Meetings, OneNote, and more to your learning management system (LMS). LMS administrators control which apps are available to their organization, and educators control which apps are available to their students. We'll continue to migrate all LTI experiences to this new framework, and new experiences will be launched here.

Microsoft Education and our third-party partners understand that the flow of teaching and learning invariably crosses solution boundaries. We're working on providing more seamless experiences, keeping educators and learners focused on their goals, rather than having to juggle tools. We're integrating Microsoft products wherever teaching and learning occurs, including within and alongside Learning Management Systems (LMS).

We've worked with our LMS partners to create a suite of tools using the [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) that brings the best of Microsoft directly into your LMS.

## Experiences that are part of the Microsoft 365 LTI

### Microsoft Assignments

The Microsoft Teams Assignments LTI brings the [Learning Accelerators](https://www.microsoft.com/education/learning-tools/learning-accelerators) to your LMS, including Reading Progress, Math Progress, Search Progress, Speaker Progress, Microsoft Forms, OneNote Pages, MakeCode, and all of the new generative AI features of Assignments. The integration allows you to add Microsoft Assignments and Learning Accelerators right into your LMS assignments or content list where students can launch and complete them and sync your grades and AI-assisted feedback automatically to the LMS gradebook.

### OneDrive and Microsoft 365 files

Bring Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft 365 directly into your most important workflows, including:

- Attach Microsoft 365 files including Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel from the Rich Content Editor.
- Distribute Microsoft 365 cloud assignments.
- View and organize your personal and course Microsoft OneDrive files.
- Create collaborations where course members can work together on shared documents in real time.
- Access multiple Microsoft OneDrive accounts, including personal and school accounts.
- Integrate Microsoft 365 files with your course modules.
- Use your Microsoft account for single sign-on with your LMS.

### OneNote Class Notebooks

Use OneNote Class Notebook with your LMS to create a shared notebook and link it to your course. Existing and new students enrolled in your LMS course can access the notebook automatically without you having to add their names.

### Reflect

Microsoft Reflect is a wellbeing app designed to foster connection, expression, and learning by promoting self-awareness, empathy, and emotional growth. Integrate Reflect into your LMS to create impactful check-ins, gain wellbeing insights, and build a happier, healthier learning community.

## Sync Teams with your LMS

Syncing Microsoft Teams with your LMS helps educators and students navigate between their LMS and Teams. Users can access their teams associated with their course within their LMS. Microsoft 365 LTI includes a Teams app to help navigate instructors and students directly to the right Team for each of their courses.

For best practices on syncing teams with your LMS, reference one of the following guides

- [Microsoft Teams with Canvas](teams-classes-with-canvas.md)
- [Microsoft Teams with Blackboard](teams-classes-with-blackboard.md)
- [Microsoft Teams with Moodle](teams-classes-meetings-with-moodle.md)
- [Microsoft Teams with Open LMS](open-lms-teams-classes-and-meetings.md)
- [Microsoft Teams with Desire2Learn Brightspace](teams-classes-meetings-with-brightspace.md)

## Classic Microsoft LTI apps

The following tools are all still fully supported and don't have scheduled retirement dates. You can continue using them while you work to adopt the new Microsoft 365 LTI. We will continue to share updated guidance on migration and our LTI roadmap plan for the future. Sign up at https://aka.ms/LMSPreview to be notified of any new releases or changes to Microsoft LTIs.
