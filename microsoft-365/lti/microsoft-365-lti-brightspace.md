# Deploy the Microsoft 365 LTI® app in Brightspace by D2L

This guide provides steps for deploying the Microsoft 365 Learning Tool Interoperability® (LTI®) app in Brightspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person who deploys this integration should be an Administrator role in the learning management system (LMS). A person in your organization who is a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator is also be needed to help complete the configuration of the app before first time use.
>
> By installing and using the Microsoft Education LTI app, educators and students can transmit grades to the LMS where the terms of use and privacy policy of that application apply.

## LMS Requirements for the Integration

### User matching between Microsoft 365/Entra ID and the LMS

To fully integrate with your LMS environment and perform tasks on behalf of users like populating students and co-teachers into OneNote Class Notebooks, setting file permissions, or sending grades from Assignments to the LMS gradebook, the Microsoft 365 LTI app must be able to map Student and Teacher identities between the LMS and the Microsoft 365 Entra ID directory services. It's required to populate the LMS user Email field (which is the same email value returned from the LTI Names and Roles Provisioning Service) with the user's Microsoft 365/Entra User UPN or Primary Email address. Verify this for people in every course that will use the integration to ensure the Microsoft apps can match LMS users.

## One-time setup by an LMS administrator

**To register the application in the Microsoft registration portal:**

1. Sign in with your **Microsoft 365** user account to the [Microsoft Registration Portal](https://lti.microsoft.com/registration).

1. Select **Add new registration**.

1. Select **Microsoft 365 LTI** and then select **Next**.

1. Enter a friendly **Registration** name (ex: "Microsoft 365 for Brightspace") and select **D2L/Brightspace** as the LMS platform (during Preview, ‘Other' can be selected). Select **Next**.

1. You're given a list of keys that need to be added to a registration you'll do in Brightspace. Copy these names and values; they're needed to complete the next few steps.

1. Leave your browser window open while you complete the tool registration steps. The Microsoft tool registration is completed late when the LMS Client ID and Deployment ID are available.

**To register the new extensibility tool, add a deployment, and add links to the tool to your courses in Brightspace:**

1. Log into Brightspace as an Administrator or Super Administrator with permission to **Manage Extensibility** and **External Tools**.

1. In Brightspace, navigate to **Admin Tools** **(gear icon)** > **Manage Extensibility** and then select the **Register Tool** button.

1. Select the **Standard** registration radio button and enter the values listed in the table:

  | **Field in Brightspace** | **Value** |
  |---|---|
  | **Name** | Microsoft Education |
  | **Domain** | Copy the **Target Link URL** value from the Microsoft registration. |
  | **Redirect URLs** | Copy the **Redirect URL** value from the Microsoft registration. |
  | **OpenID Connect Login URL** | Copy the **Open ID connection URL** value from the Microsoft registration. |
  | **Target Link URI** | Copy the **Target Link URL** value from the Microsoft registration. |

1. Check the following **Extensions** options, and add the following **Substitution Parameters** to the registration:
  :::image type="content" source="./media/brightspace-extensions-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Brightspace extensions." border="true":::

1. Select the **Register** button.

1. A modal with Brightspace registration details appears. **Copy these names and values as they need to be entered into the Microsoft Registration Portal to complete registration.** You can return to the registration to copy the values later if needed.

**To save the values obtained from Brightspace in the Microsoft tool registration portal:**

1. On the **LMS provided registration keys** tab, select **Next** to navigate to **LMS provided registration keys**. Enter the values listed in the table that were copied from Brightspace in the previous steps.

  | **Microsoft registration field** | **Brightspace registration value** |
  |---|---|
  | **Issuer ID URL** | Issuer |
  | **Client ID** | Client ID |
  | **Keyset URL** | Brightspace Keyset URL |
  | **Platform authentication URL** | OpenID Connect Authentication Endpoint |
  | **Deployment ID** | Deployment ID |
  | **Access Token URL** | Brightspace OAuth2 Access Token URL |

1. Select **Next**, review the **Review and save** page, and then select **Save and exit** to complete the update.

You now have a tool registration configured in the Microsoft registration portal and both a registration and a deployment of the tool in Brightspace. The next steps create links in Brightspace to add to courses.
