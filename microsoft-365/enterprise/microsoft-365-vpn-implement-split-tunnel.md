Microsoft suggests a strategy to improve connectivity quickly and efficiently. This involves a few simple steps to update your network routes, allowing certain key endpoints to bypass congested VPN servers. By applying a similar or better security model at different layers, there's no need to secure all traffic at the corporate network's exit point and you can route Microsoft 365 traffic using shorter and more efficient network paths. This can usually be done within hours and can be scaled to multiple Microsoft 365 workloads as needed. 

## Implement VPN split tunneling

In this article, you'll find the simple steps required to migrate your VPN client architecture from a _VPN forced tunnel_ to a _VPN forced tunnel with a few trusted exceptions_, [VPN split tunnel model #2](microsoft-365-vpn-common-scenarios.md#2-vpn-forced-tunnel-with-a-small-number-of-trusted-exceptions) in [Common VPN split tunneling scenarios for Microsoft 365](microsoft-365-vpn-common-scenarios.md).

The following diagram illustrates how the recommended VPN split tunnel solution works:

![Split tunnel VPN solution detail.](../media/vpn-split-tunneling/vpn-split-tunnel-example.png)

### 1. Identify the endpoints to optimize

In the [Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md) article, Microsoft clearly identifies the key endpoints you need to optimize and categorizes them as **Optimize**. This small group of endpoints accounts for around 70% - 80% of the volume of traffic to the Microsoft 365 service including the latency sensitive endpoints such as those for Teams media. Essentially this is the traffic that we need to take special care of and is also the traffic that will put incredible pressure on traditional network paths and VPN infrastructure.

URLs in this category have the following characteristics:

- Are Microsoft owned and managed endpoints, hosted on Microsoft infrastructure
- Have published IP addresses that are dedicated for specific services
- Low rate of change
- Are bandwidth and/or latency sensitive
- Are able to have required security elements provided in the service rather than inline on the network
- Account for around 70-80% of the volume of traffic to the Microsoft 365 service

For more information about Microsoft 365 endpoints and how they're categorized and managed, see [Managing Microsoft 365 endpoints](managing-office-365-endpoints.md).

Under most circumstances, you should only need to use URL endpoints in a [browser PAC file](managing-office-365-endpoints.md#use-a-pac-file-for-direct-routing-of-vital-microsoft-365-traffic) where the endpoints are configured to be sent direct, rather than to the proxy. If you need just the URLs for the Optimize category, use the first query, or use the second query for IP prefixes.

**Optimize URLs**

```powershell
(invoke-restmethod -Uri ("https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/WorldWide?clientrequestid=" + ([GUID]::NewGuid()).Guid)) | ?{$_.category -eq "Optimize" -and $_.urls} | select -unique -ExpandProperty urls
```

**Optimize IP address ranges**

```powershell
(invoke-restmethod -Uri ("https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/WorldWide?clientrequestid=" + ([GUID]::NewGuid()).Guid)) | ?{$_.category -eq "Optimize" -and $_.ips} | select -unique -ExpandProperty ips
```

### 2. Implementing split tunnel for Microsoft 365 endpoints

Now that we have identified these critical endpoints, we need to divert them away from the VPN tunnel and allow them to use the user's local Internet connection to connect directly to the service. The manner in which this is accomplished will vary depending on the VPN product and machine platform used but most VPN solutions allow some configuration of policy to apply this logic. For information VPN platform-specific split tunnel guidance, see [HOWTO guides for common VPN platforms](#howto-guides-for-common-vpn-platforms).

If you wish to test the solution manually, you can execute the following PowerShell example to emulate the solution at the route table level. This example adds a route for each of the Teams Media IP subnets into the route table. You can test Teams media performance before and after using the [Teams network assessment tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=103017&lc=1033&msockid=2dc7410f01b361853273545c009060bb) and observe the difference in routes for the specified endpoints.

#### Example: Add Teams Media IP subnets into the route table

```powershell
$intIndex = "" # index of the interface connected to the internet
$gateway = "" # default gateway of that interface
$destPrefix = " 52.112.0.0/14, 52.122.0.0/15, 2603:1063::/38" # Teams Media endpoints
# Add routes to the route table
foreach ($prefix in $destPrefix) {New-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix $prefix -InterfaceIndex $intIndex -NextHop $gateway}
```

In the preceding script, _$intIndex_ is the index of the interface connected to the internet (find by running **get-netadapter** in PowerShell; look for the value of _ifIndex_) and _$gateway_ is the default gateway of that interface (find by running **ipconfig** in a command prompt or **(Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway).NextHop** in PowerShell).

Once you have added the routes, you can confirm that the route table is correct by running **route print** in a command prompt or PowerShell.

To add routes for _all_ current IP address ranges in the Optimize category, you can use the following script variation to query the [Microsoft 365 IP and URL web service](microsoft-365-ip-web-service.md) for the current set of Optimize IP subnets and add them to the route table.

#### Example: Add all Optimize subnets into the route table

```powershell
$intIndex = "" # index of the interface connected to the internet
$gateway = "" # default gateway of that interface
# Query the web service for IPs in the Optimize category
$ep = Invoke-RestMethod ("https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/worldwide?clientrequestid=" + ([GUID]::NewGuid()).Guid)
# Output only IPv4 Optimize IPs to $optimizeIps
$destPrefix = $ep | where {$_.category -eq "Optimize"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ips | Where-Object { $_ -like '*.*' }
# Add routes to the route table
foreach ($prefix in $destPrefix) {New-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix $prefix -InterfaceIndex $intIndex -NextHop $gateway}
```

If you inadvertently added routes with incorrect parameters or simply wish to revert your changes, you can remove the routes you just added with the following command:

```powershell
foreach ($prefix in $destPrefix) {Remove-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix $prefix -InterfaceIndex $intIndex -NextHop $gateway}
```

<!--- remmed until we add more reliable interface selection logic
#### Example script to add Teams Media subnets to the route table

```powershell
$adapter = get-netadapter | ? {$_.Status -eq "Up"}
$adapterIndex = $adapter.ifIndex
$gateway = (Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway).NextHop

$destPrefix = "52.120.0.0/14", "52.112.0.0/14", "13.107.64.0/18"
foreach ($prefix in $destPrefix) {New-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix $prefix -InterfaceIndex $intIndex -NextHop $gateway}
```
-->

The VPN client should be configured so that traffic to the **Optimize** IPs are routed in this way. This allows the traffic to utilize local Microsoft resources such as Microsoft 365 Service Front Doors [such as the Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-front-door-service-is-now-generally-available/) that delivers Microsoft 365 services and connectivity endpoints as close to your users as possible. This allows us to deliver high performance levels to users wherever they are in the world and takes full advantage of [Microsoft's world class global network](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/how-microsoft-builds-its-fast-and-reliable-global-network/), which is likely within a few milliseconds of your users' direct egress.
