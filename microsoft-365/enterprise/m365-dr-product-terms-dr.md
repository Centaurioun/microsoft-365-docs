## FAQ

### Privacy and Security Product Terms Data Residency and Migration

**Data residency based on _Privacy and Security Product Terms_ apply, but your _Tenant_ did not elect to take part in the _Legacy Move Program_**. If your _Tenant_ is eligible for data residency based on _Privacy and Security Product Terms_, but did not elect to participate in the _Legacy Move Program_ you may see a mismatch between _Current Geography_ and _Committed Geography_. In these cases, your _Tenant_ is still eligible to retain data for _Microsoft 365 Core Workloads_ in the respective _Local Region Geography_ once it has migrated to that location. Data residency based on _Privacy and Security Product Terms_ does not currently include data migration into the _Local Region Geography_. In order to migrate the data, you must first procure ADR license(s).
