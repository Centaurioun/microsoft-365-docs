# Cross-tenant OneDrive migration

> [!NOTE]
> Information in this article refers to **Cross-tenant OneDrive migration**. For mailbox migration, see [Cross-tenant mailbox migration](/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration).

## Overview

During mergers or divestitures, you commonly need the ability to move users OneDrive accounts into a new Microsoft 365 tenant. With Cross-tenant OneDrive migration, tenant administrators can use familiar tools like *SharePoint Online PowerShell* to transition users into their new organization.

SharePoint administrators of two separate tenants can use the *Set-SPOCrossTenantRelationship* cmdlet to establish an organization relationship, and the *Start-SPOCrossTenantUserContentMove* command to begin cross-tenant OneDrive moves.

Up to 4,000 OneDrive accounts can be scheduled for migration in advance at a given time. Once scheduled, migrations occur without the user's data ever leaving the Microsoft 365 cloud and with minimal disruption, requiring only a few minutes where a user's OneDrive is read-only. When migrations are complete, a redirect is placed in the location of the user's original OneDrive, so any links to files and folders can continue working in the new location.

>[!Important]
>Cross-Tenant moves are a one and done migration activity. The content is **moved** from the Source to Target, leaving behind a redirect link on Source. **Incremental and delta migration passes cannot be performed.**

> [!NOTE]
> This feature isn't supported for users of the Government Cloud, including GCC, Consumer, GCC High, or DoD.

## Licensing

>[!Important]
>As of Nov. 2022, Cross Tenant User Data Migration is available as an add-on to the following Microsoft 365 subscription plans for Enterprise Agreement customers, and is required for cross-tenant migrations. User licenses are per migration (one-time fee) and can be assigned either on the source or target user object. This license also covers Cross-tenant mailbox migration.  Contact your Microsoft account team for details.
>
>The Cross Tenant User Data Migration add-on is available as a separate purchase for Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium; Microsoft 365 F1/F3/E3/E5; Office 365 F3/E1/E3/E5; Exchange Online; SharePoint in Microsoft 365; and OneDrive for Business.

>[!Warning]
>You must have purchased, or verified that you can purchase, cross tenant user data migration licenses prior to the next steps. Migrations fail if this step isn't completed. Microsoft doesn't offer exceptions for this licensing requirement.

## Prerequisites and settings

- **Microsoft SharePoint Online Powershell**. Confirm you have the most recent version installed. [Download SharePoint Online Management Shell from the official Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588).

- **Confirm that the source OneDrive tenant doesn't have Service encryption with Microsoft Purview Customer Key enabled**. If enabled on the source tenant, the migration fails. [Learn more on Service encryption with Microsoft Purview Customer Key](/microsoft-365/compliance/customer-key-overview).

- **Source OneDrive accounts must be set to Read/Write**. If set to Read only, they fail.

## Precreate target accounts

- Ensure all users and groups identified for migration are precreated on the target tenant.
- Assign the appropriate licenses to each user on the target tenant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OneDrive sites should **NOT** be created before **OR** during a migration.
>
> OneDrive site creation should be restricted in the target tenant to prevent users from creating OneDrive sites. If a OneDrive site already exists for the user on the target tenant, the migration fails. You can't overwrite an existing site.
>
> If users continue to access resources in the source tenant, you should restrict OneDrive creation in the source tenant to prevent creating new OneDrive sites.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about restricting OneDrive site creation, see [Disable OneDrive creation for some users](/sharepoint/manage-user-profiles#disable-onedrive-creation-for-some-users)

## Path size limits

Microsoft limits the number of characters in a path to not exceed 400 characters. This limit is for the full path limit, not just the file name. In planning your migrations, review the length of OneDrive URL names in your target tenant. Failure often occurs when files or folder paths from the source, combined with the OneDrive URL on the target exceed the 400-character path limit.

A migration detects if the character limit is exceeded. Work with the site owner to update the file/folder directory structure to reduce file path lengths.

Any legal URL is accepted when creating your Identity Map from Source to Target for your migrations. At this current time usernames/URLs that contain an apostrophe character ( **'** ) in a username/URL fails with an "invalid character" error when attempting the migration.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend keeping your target OneDrive URL names short to avoid exceeding the character limit.

## OneDrive account size limits

Each OneDrive account can have a maximum of 5 TB of content or one million items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The one million item limit can be any *item*, including files (and versions), folders, and list line entries if it's a list or library.
>
>If you attempt to migrate any OneDrive site that exceeds the five terabyte quota, the transfer fails.

## Permissions

All users and groups included in the identity mapping file that you uploaded to the target tenant maintain permissions in the target tenant related to the migrated OneDrive site.

## Legal holds

OneDrive accounts with a Hold policy applied are blocked from migration. To migrate these OneDrive accounts, remove the hold policy, migrate, then reapply the hold as needed on the target tenant.

## Shared files

After a OneDrive account is migrated, anyone clicking on a shared link to the old location is redirected to the new one, provided they still have access to the destination.

Those redirects remain until the source tenant is deprovisioned. The admin can also selectively remove redirects site-by-site.

## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to the source and the target tenants](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step1.md).  
- **Step 2:** [Establish trust between the source and the target tenant](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step2.md)
- **Step 3:** [Verify trust is established](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step3.md)
- **Step 4:** [Precreate users and groups](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step4.md)  
- **Step 5:** [Prepare identity mapping](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step5.md)
- **Step 6:** [Start a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step6.md)
- **Step 7:** [Post migration steps](cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step7.md)
