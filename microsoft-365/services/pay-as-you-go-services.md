# Pay-as-you-go services available in Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 offers a flexible pay-as-you-go model that allows your organization to use powerful services without committing to full licenses. You only pay for what you use, making it easier to scale services based on actual needs. This article outlines the Microsoft 365 services currently available under the pay-as-you-go model.
