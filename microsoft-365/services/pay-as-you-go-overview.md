# Overview of pay-as-you-go services in Microsoft 365

In today’s fast-paced business world, flexibility and cost control are key. Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services provide your organization with a scalable and economical solution, allowing you to pay only for the services you use. This documentation offers an in-depth look at Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services, their benefits, and step-by-step guides for setting them up.

## Key benefits

### Flexible and scalable

One of the biggest advantages of pay-as-you-go services is their flexibility. Unlike traditional licensing models that require upfront purchases and fixed commitments, pay-as-you-go services let your organization adjust usage as needed—scaling up during busy periods and scaling down when demand is lower. This is especially useful for businesses with changing or unpredictable needs, as it reduces unnecessary costs and simplifies license management.

### Simplified billing

Pay-as-you-go services improve billing flexibility by letting your organization connect Microsoft 365 usage to an Azure subscription. This setup simplifies billing by consolidating charges in one place, making it easier to track, manage, and allocate costs across departments or projects.

### Wide range of services

Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go gives you access to a broad set of services, including SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Syntex, Microsoft 365 Archive, Microsoft 365 Backup, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. This allows your organization to choose and use only the tools it needs—when it needs them—without committing to full licenses upfront.
