# Overview of pay-as-you-go services in Microsoft 365

In today's dynamic business environment, flexibility and cost efficiency are essential. Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services provide organizations with a scalable and economical solution, allowing them to pay only for the services they use. This documentation offers an in-depth look at Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services, their benefits, and a step-by-step guide for setting them up.

## Benefits of using pay-as-you-go services

### Flexibility and cost efficiency

One of the primary advantages of pay-as-you-go services is the flexibility they offer. Unlike traditional license-based models, pay-as-you-go allows your organization to scale usage up or down based on your needs. This model is beneficial for businesses with variable or unpredictable usage patterns, as it eliminates the need for upfront purchasing and reduces the overhead of license procurement.

### Enhanced billing flexibility

Pay-as-you-go services offer enhanced billing flexibility by allowing organizations to link an Azure subscription. This integration streamlines billing and cost management, making it easier for your organization to manage and allocate costs across different business units.

### Access to a wide range of services

Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services encompass a wide range of Microsoft 365 products, including SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange, Teams, and Copilot services.
