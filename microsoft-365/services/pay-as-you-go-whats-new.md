# What's new with pay-as-you-go services in Microsoft 365
  
This article provides an overview of the latest updates and enhancements in Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services, giving admins a comprehensive understanding of the new features.

## Enhanced navigation and user experience  

### Streamlined setup and management  

One of the most notable updates is the streamlined setup and management experience for pay-as-you-go services. The navigation within the Microsoft 365 admin center is revamped to make it easier for admins to configure and manage pay-as-you-go services. The entry point for **Activate pay-as-you-go-services** is relocated from the **Files and content** section to the **Billing and licenses** section in the setup navigation, offering a centralized location for managing billing and licenses.

### Improved billing flexibility  

The billing policies allow organizations to link their environments to an Azure subscription, enabling streamlined billing and cost management. This integration simplifies the process of managing and splitting costs across different business units, making it easier for enterprises to monitor and control their expenses  

## New pay-as-you-go services  

### SharePoint agents  

SharePoint agents are AI-powered assistants that help users navigate and interact with SharePoint sites and document libraries. These agents can answer questions, summarize content, and perform specific tasks based on user permissions. Enterprises can now set up pay-as-you-go billing for SharePoint agents, allowing users to utilize these features without needing a full Copilot license.

### Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat provide a conversational interface for users to interact with their work data. These agents can answer questions, perform actions, and provide insights based on the data available in the organization's Microsoft Graph and third-party data sources. Pay-as-you-go billing allows organizations to enable these agents and pay based on the number of messages used.
