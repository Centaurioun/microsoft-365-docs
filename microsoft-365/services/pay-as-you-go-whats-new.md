# What's new with pay-as-you-go services in Microsoft 365
  
Microsoft 365 continues to expand its pay-as-you-go offerings, giving your organization more flexibility and control over how you use and pay for services. This article highlights the latest updates, including improvements to the admin experience and newly available services.

## Enhanced navigation and user experience  

### Streamlined setup and management  

Setting up and managing pay-as-you-go services is now easier than ever. The Microsoft 365 admin center has been updated with a more intuitive layout. The entry point for activating pay-as-you-go services has moved from the **Files and content** section to the **Billing and licenses** section under **Setup**. This change provides a more centralized and logical location for managing both billing and service activation.

### Improved billing flexibility  

Your organization can now link their Microsoft 365 environments to an Azure subscription for billing. This integration simplifies cost tracking and enables better cost allocation across departments or business units—making it easier to manage budgets and monitor usage.

## New pay-as-you-go services  

### SharePoint agents  

These AI-powered assistants help users interact with SharePoint sites and document libraries. They can answer questions, summarize content, and perform tasks based on user permissions. Organizations can now enable SharePoint agents on a pay-as-you-go basis—no full Copilot license required.

### Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

These conversational agents allow users to interact with their work data using natural language. They can answer questions, perform actions, and provide insights using data from Microsoft Graph and other sources. With pay-as-you-go billing, you only pay for the messages used.
