# Allow members to send as or send on behalf of a group

A member of a Microsoft 365 group who has been granted **Send as** or **Send on behalf** permissions can send email as the group, or on behalf of the group. (Guests in the group can't be granted these permissions.)

This article explains how a global or Exchange administrator can set these permissions.
  
For example, if Megan Bowen is part of the **Training** Microsoft 365 group, and has **Send as** permissions on the group, if she sends an email as the group, it will look like the **Training** group sent the email. 
  
The **Send on Behalf** permission lets a user send email on behalf of a Microsoft 365 group. For example, if Alex Wilber is a part of the **Marketing** Microsoft 365 group, and has **Send on Behalf** permissions and sends an email as the group, the email looks like it was sent by **Alex Wilber on behalf of Marketing**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can configure **Send as** or **Send on behalf** for a given user, but not both. If you configure both, it will default to **Send as**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Send as** and **Send on behalf** aren't supported on Outlook for Mac in hybrid Exchange configurations.

## Considerations for scheduling meetings
> [!NOTE]
> Meeting invitations sent from a Microsoft 365 group mailbox currently display the sender as *User on behalf of Group*, even if **Send as** permission is assigned. There's no native method for meeting invites to appear purely as the group.
