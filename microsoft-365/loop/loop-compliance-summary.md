# Summary of governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities for Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, and Loop

As a Compliance Manager or IT administrator, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest governance, data lifecycle, and compliance posture for the software solutions being used in your organization. This article details the capabilities available and not available yet for [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

## Purview and SharePoint Embedded

All SharePoint Embedded containers are targeted using the "All SharePoint Sites" scope in Microsoft Purview. For example, if configuring Retention Policies, the configuration you specify that targets All SharePoint Sites will apply to every Copilot Pages and Copilot Notebooks container in SharePoint Embedded, and every Loop workspace in SharePoint Embedded. This includes all ownership types: user, group, and tenant owned SharePoint Embedded containers.

<a name="loop-workspace-url"></a>
<sup>\*</sup> If you need to specify an individual Loop workspace or the Copilot Pages and Copilot Notebooks container for a retention policy or another compliance feature, specify the workspace as you would a SharePoint site, by its URL. To locate this URL, sign in to the SharePoint admin center with the [SharePoint Embedded administrator role](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/adminrole). Then navigate to **Containers** > **Active containers** or **Deleted containers** where you can view the details of a selected Loop workspace or Copilot Pages and Copilot Notebooks container. From the flyout pane, **General** tab, copy the container URL.

Note: When a user selects the Copilot Pages module in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, a SharePoint Embedded container is currently created automatically—even if the user does not go on to create a Copilot Page. If no files are added to the container, the system will later delete it automatically. *This behavior is temporary.* An update is in progress to ensure that a Copilot Pages container is only created when a user actually creates a Copilot Page. Until that update is deployed, IT administrators and compliance officers can safely disregard these system-initiated deletions. These containers do not contain any user-generated content when they are removed.

## Summary of governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities **not yet available**

The following sections detail capabilities that are **not yet available** to make it easier to evaluate the smaller list of capabilities your organization might require.

### Admin Management not yet available

- **Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, My workspace**: Unlike OneDrive, for Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, and the My workspace, there is no workflow for content stored in the user-owned SharePoint Embedded container after user departure. It is deleted on the same schedule as the default OneDrive settings. See [storage management after user departure](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission#storage-management-after-user-departure) for detailed information.
- **Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks**: An end-user recycle bin for deleted Copilot Pages or Copilot Notebooks isn't available.
- **Loop**: When users delete an entire Loop workspace, that Loop workspace isn't available in an **end-user visible Recycle bin**. Furthermore, restoring the Loop workspace using admin tooling doesn't update in the Loop app user experience. The user would need to visit a saved page link for a restored workspace in order to see it again. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421615 addresses this.
- **Loop**: All shared Loop workspaces are created as tenant-owned, in the tenant default geo. This behavior is consistent with SharePoint Communication sites created in the SharePoint UX, where the creator's preferred data location is not used. See [storage management after user departure](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission#storage-management-after-user-departure) for more information on managing workspaces.
- **Loop**: **Individual controls for guest or external sharing** of a specific Loop workspace isn't available.

### eDiscovery capabilities not yet available

- **Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, Loop**: Full text search of content within .loop files in review sets isn't available.

### Microsoft 365 retention and deletion capabilities not available

- **Copilot Pages, Loop**: Retention labels cannot be viewed or applied directly from a Copilot Page or Loop component outside the Loop app. Instead, the user must navigate to the Copilot Page or Loop component within the Loop app itself to view or apply a retention label on a Loop component or page.
- **Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, My workspace**: Retention labels that mark the content as a record or regulatory record can't be manually applied in the Loop app. If content is automatically labeled as a record, locking and unlocking this record is not yet available.
- For clarification only, not a limitation: retention labels do not apply to containers like SharePoint sites or Loop workspaces; instead, use retention policies for these containers. See [retention](/purview/retention) to learn more.

## Managing Copilot Pages, Copilot Notebooks, and Loop in your organization

By reviewing this information, you can make an informed decision on whether Microsoft Loop is ready for use as a software solution in your organization. As always, we continue to update this and other documentation to provide the compliance status of Microsoft Loop to help you make the best decisions for your organization.
