# Summary of governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities for Copilot Pages and Loop

As a Compliance Manager or IT administrator, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest governance, data lifecycle, and compliance posture for the software solutions being used in your organization. This article details the capabilities available and not available yet for [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

## Summary table of admin management, governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities based on where Loop content is stored

<sup>\*</sup> If you need to specify an individual Loop workspace or the Copilot Pages container for a retention policy or another compliance feature, specify the workspace as you would a SharePoint site, by its URL. To locate this URL, sign in to the SharePoint admin center with the [SharePoint Embedded administrator role](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/adminrole). Then navigate to **Containers** > **Active containers** or **Deleted containers** where you can view the details of a selected Loop workspace or Copilot Pages container. From the flyout pane, **General** tab, copy the container URL.

## Summary of governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities **not yet available**

The following sections detail capabilities that are **not yet available** for Microsoft Loop to make it easier to evaluate the smaller list of capabilities your organization might require before using Microsoft Loop. As denoted in the summary table, the content applies to Loop workspaces only.

### Admin Management not yet available

- When users delete an entire Loop workspace, that Loop workspace isn't available in an **end-user visible Recycle bin**. Furthermore, restoring the Loop workspace using admin tooling doesn't update in the Loop app user experience. The user would need to visit a saved page link for a restored workspace in order to see it again. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421615 addresses this.
- Unlike OneDrive, for Copilot Pages and the My workspace, there is no workflow for content stored in the user-owned SharePoint Embedded container after user departure. It is deleted on the same schedule as the default OneDrive settings. See [storage management after user departure](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission#storage-management-after-user-departure) for detailed information.
- All shared Loop workspaces are created as tenant-owned, in the tenant default geo like SharePoint Communication sites, not in the creator's preferred data location. See [storage management after user departure](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission#storage-management-after-user-departure) for more information on managing workspaces.
- **Individual controls for guest or external sharing** of a specific Loop workspace isn't available.

### eDiscovery capabilities not yet available

- Full text search of content within .loop files in review sets isn't available.

### Microsoft 365 retention and deletion capabilities not available

- Retention labels cannot be viewed or applied directly from a Loop component outside the Loop app. Instead, the user must navigate to the Loop component within the Loop app itself to view or apply a retention label on a Loop component or page.
- Retention labels that mark the content as a record or regulatory record can't be manually applied in the Loop app and if content is automatically labeled as a record, locking and unlocking this record is not yet available.
- For clarification only, not a limitation: retention labels have never been applied to containers like SharePoint sites or Loop workspaces; instead, use retention policies for these containers. See [retention](/purview/retention) to learn more.

## Managing Loop in your organization

By reviewing this information, you can make an informed decision on whether Microsoft Loop is ready for use as a software solution in your organization. As always, we continue to update this and other documentation to provide the compliance status of Microsoft Loop to help you make the best decisions for your organization.
