# Manage people data and related experinces from the microsoft 365 admin center

Overview__:__ 

The _People settings_ section in the Microsoft 365 admin center is a unified single location for IT admins to manage all people-related settings in their organization.

_(Screenshot: Example of the People settings section in Org settings, showing sub-sections like Profile cards.)_

__How to access the People settings section__

1. __Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center__ with an account that has the necessary admin role.

1. In the left navigation pane, go to __Settings__ and select __Org settings__.

1. On the Org settings page, find the __Services__ tab (the list of service-specific settings).

1. Select __People settings__ from the list of services.

__Note:__ To view or modify People settings, you must be a __Global Administrator__ or have the __People Administrator__ role in Microsoft 365 ([About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide)). The People Administrator role is a specialized admin role that allows managing people-centric features (like updating profile card settings, pronouns, and name pronunciations) without granting full global admin permissions. Global Readers can view these settings (read-only).

__To assign the People Administrator role to a user:__

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to __Roles > Role assignments__.

1. Search for __People Administrator__ in the list of roles, and select it.

1. In the role details pane, choose __Assigned admins__, then __Add__ and select the user(s) you want to assign.

1. Save your changes.

Once assigned, that user can navigate to __Settings > Org settings > People settings__ and will have full access to configure those settings (just like a Global Admin would).

__Release and future updates__

The People settings section is part of an ongoing effort to improve administrative control over Microsoft 365's people-centric features. Initially (in the first release), it includes the settings for <link to support article of this feature> __profile card enrichment__. Looking forward, Microsoft plans to expand this section to other people-centric experiences related settings as well.
