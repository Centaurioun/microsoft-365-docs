# Enable developers to use app analytics in the Developer Portal for Teams

We're introducing the new **Developer Portal for Teams** organizational setting in the Microsoft 365 admin center to allow enterprise app developers to view and use app analytics for company apps in the Developer Portal. Developer Portal is a tool for managing apps and agents built for Copilot and Microsoft 365 apps. By viewing custom app usage, enterprise developers can see the number of active users and get other insights. Admins can allow app usage for your custom apps to be shown in the Developer Portal.

To enable the setting, in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, under **Org settings**, select **Developer Portal for Teams** and then enable the setting in the flyout pane as shown in the following image:

## How will this setting affect admins and their organization?

When you enable this setting, enterprise developers are provided with better insights into the performance and user engagement of custom apps, helping them make informed decisions about app improvements. By default, this setting is disabled. Disabling this setting might prevent developers from accessing and understanding app usage and other insights, causing disruptive change to their workflow.

## What actions are needed from admins?

To enable enterprise developers to view app usage, enable the setting in **Microsoft 365 admin center -> Settings -> Org settings -> Services -> Developer Portal for Teams**.
