# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft 365 Apps usage

The Microsoft 365 Reports dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview article](activity-reports.md).

For example, you can understand the activity of each user licensed to use Microsoft 365 Apps apps by looking at their activity across the apps and how they are utilized across platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> Shared computer activations are not included in this report.

## How to get to the Microsoft 365 Apps usage report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page. 
2. From the dashboard homepage, under Reports, select **Microsoft 365 apps** > **Usage**.

## Interpret the Microsoft 365 Apps usage report

You can get a view into your user's Microsoft 365 Apps activity by looking at the **Users** and **Platform** charts.

> ![Microsoft 365 Apps usage report.](../../media/0bcf67e6-a6e4-4109-a215-369f9f20ad84.png)

The **Microsoft 365 Apps usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

The data in each report usually covers up to the last two days. Every six days, we will refresh the report with minor updates to ensure data quality.

The **Users** view shows the trend in the number of active users for each app – Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Teams. "Active users" are any who perform any intentional actions within these apps.

The **Platforms** view shows the trend of active users across all apps for each platform – Windows, Mac, Web, and Mobile.

On the Users chart, the Y-axis is the number of unique active users for the respective app. On the Platforms chart, the Y-axis is the number of unique users for the respective platform. The X-axis on both charts is the date on which an app was used on a given platform.

You can filter the series you see on the chart by selecting an item in the legend. For example, on the Users chart, select Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, or Teams to see only the info related to each one. Changing this selection doesn't change the info in the grid table below it.

## Outlook for Windows migration

The **Outlook for Windows migration process** view provides organizations with valuable insights into the adoption of the new Outlook for Windows, as well as trends in migration from the classic version to the new version.
