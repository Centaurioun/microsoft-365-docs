### Optimize your organization’s SharePoint storage

Explore ways to manage your storage through setting file history limits, archiving inactive sites<sup>1</sup>, and creating site lifecycle management policies<sup>1</sup>. To increase SharePoint storage capacity, buy more storage in one-gigabyte increments. For more information about planning for SharePoint storage, see [SharePoint storage planning](/sharepoint/sharepoint-storage-planning).

<sup>1</sup> Additional licensing charges might apply.

### Total usage

Review the total storage used by your tenant, total storage quota, and available storage quota. For more information about SharePoint limits, see [SharePoint limits - Service Descriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits).

### Usage trend

Understand your tenant’s storage growth trend and use the estimated future storage usage based on past usage to make informed decisions on when to buy more storage or clean up usage.

### Featured resources
