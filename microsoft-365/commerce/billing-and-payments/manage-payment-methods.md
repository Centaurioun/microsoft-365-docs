# Manage payment methods for Microsoft business accounts

> [!NOTE]
> This article only applies to Microsoft business accounts. If you have an app, game, or nonbusiness subscriptions, see [Change your Microsoft subscription payment method and options - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/39ab4bc1-01f9-fc28-c3a5-49e87b6e7611).

When you buy Microsoft business products or services, you can use an existing payment method to pay for them or add a new one. You can use a credit card or debit card to pay for the things you buy. Depending on your country/region, alternative payment methods might be supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You must use a payment method issued from the same country/region as your tenant.
> - The option to pay with a bank account is no longer available.
> - Prepaid cards like stored value cards, Visa gift cards, and MasterCard gift cards aren't accepted as valid payment methods.

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with the steps in this article, consider [working with a Microsoft small business specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2186871). With Business Assist, you and your employees get around-the-clock access to small business specialists as you grow your business, from onboarding to everyday use.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, or a Billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For more information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md).
- If you have a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA), you must be at least a Billing Administrator to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
- If you have an MCA billing account type and you're a Billing profile owner or contributor, you can use the billing profile backed by a credit or debit card or invoice payment to make purchases or pay bills. If you're a Billing invoice manager, you can only use a billing profile to pay bills. To learn more about billing profiles and roles, see [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](manage-billing-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner.

## Watch: Update your payment method

## Add a payment method

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding a payment method doesn't associate it with any subscriptions or billing profiles you have. If you want to use the new payment method to pay for a subscription, you must move a subscription to it or replace an existing payment method in a billing profile or subscription.

If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can replace the payment method for all subscriptions that use another payment method as part of adding a new one. You can also replace a payment method later on.

### Add a payment method for an MCA or MOSA account

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.

   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select the **Products** tab, then select **View payment methods**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page, and select the **Payment methods** tab.

2. Select **Add a payment method**.
3. If your country/region supports an alternate payment option, you see the selection in this step. Select the option you want to add and follow the **Add payment method** form.

   - Some alternate payment types might redirect you to your bank for verification. Don't click away of the Microsoft 365 admin center tab. After the verification is complete, you're automatically redirected back to the admin center.

4. In the **Add a payment method** pane, enter the information for the new payment method, then select **Save**.
5. To use the new payment method to pay for a subscription, you must move a subscription to it or replace an existing payment method in a billing profile.

## Replace a payment method

When you replace an existing payment method, you can add a new one or use a payment method that's already in your account.

If you have an MCA billing account type, you can replace the payment method currently linked with a billing profile. If you have an MOSA billing account type, you can replace the payment method associated with one or more subscriptions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replacing a payment method doesn't delete the existing payment method. The old payment method is still available for you to select and use for other subscriptions and billing profiles. Learn how to delete a payment method.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>.

   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select the **Products** tab, then select **View payment methods**.
   - If you're using the **Dashboard view**, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102895" target="_blank">Bills & payments</a> page, and select the **Payment methods** tab.

2. Select the **More actions** button (three dots) for the payment method you want to replace, then select **Replace**.
3. The **Replace payment method** wizard opens and you see the details for the current payment method. The **Replace for** section indicates if you're replacing the payment method for subscriptions (MOSA) or a billing profile (MCA).
4. Under **Choose payment method to move subscriptions**, select either **Use another payment method** or **Add a payment method**.

   - If you chose **Use another payment method**, select an alternate payment method from the drop-down list, then select **Next**.

5. On the **Review details and replace** page, you see the current payment method, the new payment method, and the associated subscriptions or billing profiles associated with the new payment method. Select **Replace payment method**, then select **Close**.

## Edit payment method details

You can change the name, billing address, or expiration date for an existing credit or debit card. However, you can't change the card number. If the account number changed, replace it with a different payment method, and then delete the old one.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>.

   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select the **Products** tab, then select **View payment methods**.

2. Select the **More actions** button (three dots) for the payment method you want to update, then select Edit.
3. In the **Edit payment method** pane, update your payment method information, including the name on the credit or debit card, billing address, or expiration date.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you update a credit or debit card, you must enter the security code before any changes are saved.

4. Select **Save**.

## Delete a payment method

You can only delete a payment method that isn't attached to a subscription or billing profile. This applies to all subscriptions, regardless of their status.

### Delete a payment method with no subscriptions or billing profiles attached

If a payment method isn't associated with any subscriptions or billing profiles, you can immediately delete it.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>.

2. Select the **More actions** button (three dots) for the payment method you want to delete, then select **Delete**.
3. The **Delete payment method** wizard open. If the payment method isn't associated with any billing profiles or subscriptions, you see the message "No subscriptions linked to this payment method."
4. Select **Delete payment method**. When you see the success message, select **Close**.

### Delete a payment method with subscriptions or billing profiles attached

If a payment method is attached to any subscriptions or billing profiles, you must replace it with an existing payment method or add a new one before deleting the payment method. This can be completed in the **Delete payment method** flow.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>.

   - If you're using the **Simplified view**, select the **Products** tab, then select **View payment methods**.

2. Select the **More actions** button (three dots) for the payment method you want to delete then select **Delete**.
3. The **Delete payment method** wizard opens and you see the payment method details of the payment method that's currently in use. The **Replace for** section shows the number of billing profiles or subscriptions associated with the payment method.
4. Under **Choose payment method to move subscriptions**, select either **Select a payment method** or **Add a new payment method**.

   - If you chose **Select a payment method**, select an alternate payment method from the drop-down list, then select **Next**.

|**My credit or debit card was declined.** |If you pay by credit or debit card, and your card is declined, you receive an email that says Microsoft was unable to process the payment. Double-check that the card details&mdash;card number, expiration date, name on the card, and address, including city, state, and ZIP code&mdash;appear exactly as they do on the card and your statement. You can update your card information and resubmit the payment.<br/><br/>Also confirm you have sufficient funds in your account to support the payment.<br/><br/>For more information, see [What if I have an outstanding balance?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-i-have-an-outstanding-balance)<br/><br/>If you continue to see the "declined" message, contact your bank. It's possible that your card isn't active, or you might have insufficient funds. |
|**I want to update a credit or debit card number.** |You can't change the card on an existing payment method. If you want to replace a credit or debit card number, [replace it with a different payment method](#replace-a-payment-method), which moves all active subscriptions from the payment method to the new one. |
