# View your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center

> [!NOTE]
> This article only applies to Microsoft business subscriptions. If you have an app, game, or nonbusiness subscription, see [View your Microsoft Store order history](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/view-your-microsoft-store-order-history-aafefe88-3ec2-ce28-e0b6-eff1d5cc8170).

You can view your invoice for your Microsoft business subscription in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you need help with interpreting the charges that you see on your invoice, [find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts). Then, for a detailed walkthrough of the billing statement, see either [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MCA billing account](understand-your-invoice.md) or [Understand your invoice for your Microsoft MOSA billing account](understand-your-invoice2.md).

**Have a problem with your bill?** [Contact support for business products](../../admin/get-help-support.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 services don't provide payment receipts. For credit or debit card payments, use the invoice and your credit or debit card billing statement to match your payment.
