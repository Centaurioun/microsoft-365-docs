# Contact volume licensing support

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to contact support for volume licensing (VL) customers only. If you're not a VL customer, see [Get support - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn](../../admin/get-help-support.md).

## Create an online support case

### Step 1. Create a new support request

1. Go to the [online support request form](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=2afa6f15-b710-db46-909a-8346017c802f).
2. Under **What product or service do you need help with**, select your agreement type from the drop-down list. For example, **Enterprise Agreement** or **Open Value or Open Value Subscription**.
3. Under **Which category best describes the issue**, from the drop-down list, select the category that most closely matches your issue.
4. Under **Types of Support**, select **Professional No Charge**.
5. Enter your location, time zone and whether you prefer that we contact you by phone or by email.

### Step 2. Describe the issue you're facing

- Enter a summary of the issue, then use the template to provide more details about your issue.
- Be sure to include the VL agreement number your issue relates to.
- To help us understand the problem, attach screenshots of any error message or technical issue.

### Step 3. Add contact details and sharing

- The person who submits the case is the **Primary Contact** for the support case.
- To add any other contacts who require visibility to the support case, select **Add a new contact**. Enter a new email address, then select **Save**.

### Step 4. Submit support case

- After you provide all the required information, select **Submit**.
- After you submit the support case, you see your case number and you also receive a confirmation email  from support\@mail.support.microsoft.com. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your junk folder.
- VL support contacts you during business hours to resolve the issue.
- You can check your case status online, using the **Manage** tab at [https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/manage](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/manage).

## Contact volume licensing support by phone with your case number

Depending on your location, you might be able to call the VL support team.

- Be ready to provide your case number and VL agreement number.
- You might have to provide extra user information to help triage technical issues, particularly issues related to user profiles and agreement permissions.
- If you don't have an existing case, it's faster to create an [online support request](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=2afa6f15-b710-db46-909a-8346017c802f) and avoid the need for support advocates to gather your contact details.
- Depending on your contact preference, support responds via phone or email  within 24 business hours.

## Volume licensing support contact information

Use the information in the following tables to find the support number for your location. If your country/region isn't listed, create an online support request.

> [!NOTE]
> Phone calls to a non-toll-free number for a support team in a different location might incur call charges.
