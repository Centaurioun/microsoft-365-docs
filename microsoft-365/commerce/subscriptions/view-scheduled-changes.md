# View scheduled changes made by your Microsoft representative

If you bought your Microsoft business subscription through a Microsoft representative, they can schedule changes to your subscription to start when your subscription renews. Scheduled changes include changes to the license quantity, converting your subscription to a different product, or changing your billing frequency or subscription length. For example, your representative can schedule a change to add 10 licenses to your subscription, or  change from a single subscription to three different subscriptions. These changes take place when your subscription renews.

As an admin, you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage subscriptions that contain scheduled changes created by your Microsoft representative. This article explains how to view these scheduled changes and describes the actions you can and can’t take on such subscriptions.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- You must have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, and you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, or a Billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner.

## View scheduled changes

If you need to make changes to a scheduled subscription, contact your Microsoft representative. You can view scheduled changes in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, then go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that you negotiated with your Microsoft representative for renewal.
3. To see details of what changes are set to occur at renewal, select **View scheduled changes**.
4. Any new subscriptions that are set to begin at renewal are listed on the **Your products** page with the status **Scheduled**.

## Actions on subscriptions with scheduled changes

> [!NOTE]
> You can’t take any action on a subscription that has a future start until after the start date.

You can immediately add licenses to a subscription with scheduled changes. However, when a subscription contains scheduled changes created by a Microsoft representative, certain actions are restricted. If you need to make immediate changes to a subscription with scheduled changes, or if you have any questions regarding scheduled changes, contact your Microsoft representative.

For subscriptions that contain scheduled changes, you can’t take the following actions:

- Modify the edit recurring billing setting
- Remove licenses from the subscription
- Change subscription length or billing frequency
- Upgrade or downgrade the subscription
- Replace an existing scheduled renewal created by the representative with another scheduled change
