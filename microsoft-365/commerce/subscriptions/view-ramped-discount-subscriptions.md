# View subscriptions with ramped discounts

If you bought your Microsoft business subscription through a Microsoft representative, you can use *ramped discounts* with your subscription to get variable subscription discounts based on the subscription’s length and billing frequency. These discounts are only available through a Microsoft representative.

## Before you begin

- [Find out what type of billing account you have](../manage-billing-accounts.md#view-my-billing-accounts).
- You must have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing account type, and you must be a Billing account owner or contributor, or a Billing profile owner or contributor to do the tasks in this article. For information about billing account and billing profile roles, see [Understand your Microsoft business billing account](../manage-billing-accounts.md) and [Manage your Microsoft business billing profiles](../billing-and-payments/manage-billing-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the person who signed up for the subscription, you're automatically a Billing account owner.

## Understand ramped discounts

A ramped discount provides flexible pricing that adapts to different billing frequencies, like quarterly or yearly payments. The following table shows an example of how a ramped discount might look for a three-year subscription with yearly payments:

|Discount period  |List price  |Discount price  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1/1/2025 - 12/31/2025 |$20 / month |$14 / month |
|1/1/2026 - 12/31/2026 |$20 |$17 |
|1/1/2027 - 12/31/2027 |$20 |$19 |

The following table shows how a ramped discount adjusts over four periods for a one year subscription with quarterly payments:

|Discount period  |List price  |Discount price  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1/1/2025 - 3/31/2025 |$20 / month |$12 / month |
|4/1/2025 - 6/30/2025 |$20 |$14 |
|7/1/2025 - 9/31/2025 |$20 |$16 |
|10/1/2025 - 12/31/2025 |$20 |$18 |

## Actions on subscriptions with a ramped discount

Certain actions are restricted for subscriptions with ramped discounts:

- You can increase the license quantity. The new licenses are billed at the current subscription price and adjust along with the rest of the licenses. To learn how to increase the license quantity, see [Buy or remove licenses for a Microsoft business subscription](../licenses/buy-licenses.md).
- You can schedule a change to remove licenses at renewal. However, to remove licenses immediately, you must contact your Microsoft representative. To learn how to decrease the license quantity, see [Buy or remove licenses for a Microsoft business subscription](../licenses/buy-licenses.md).
- You can upgrade a subscription immediately or at renewal, or schedule a change to a different subscription at renewal, but you lose any existing discounts. To learn how to change your subscription, see [Upgrade or change to a different Microsoft 365 for business plan](upgrade-to-different-plan.md).
- You can’t cancel a product with a ramped discount because it was bought through a Microsoft representative. To cancel, you must contact your Microsoft representative.
