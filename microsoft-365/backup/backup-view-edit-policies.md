# Create, view, and edit backup policies in Microsoft 365 Backup

## Create backup policies

To use Microsoft 365 Backup for SharePoint, Exchange, or OneDrive, you need to create a backup policy for each product. A *policy* represents the backup plan defined by admins for protecting the Microsoft 365 data of an organization.

A policy contains details of what data (SharePoint sites, Exchange mailboxes, and OneDrive accounts) to protect. Although you see the retention period and backup frequency (which defines the restore point objective), those settings aren't currently variable or modifiable.

You can create more than one backup policy for each product (SharePoint, Exchange, OneDrive) with a limit of 100 policies per product. This allows you to segregate your data by logical partitions like department, geography etc. for ease of management & administration. Please note that any SharePoint site, Exchange mailbox, or OneDrive account can be part of one backup policy only.

Select the **SharePoint**, **Exchange**, or **OneDrive** tab for steps to create a backup policy for that product.

# [SharePoint](#tab/sharepoint)

Follow these steps to set up a backup policy for SharePoint sites using Microsoft 365 Backup.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft 365 Backup** from the list of products.

4. On the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **SharePoint** section, select **Set up policy**.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Backup page with SharePoint highlighted.](../media/m365-backup/backup-setup-backup-page-sharepoint.png)

5. On the **Overview** page, review the backup features for SharePoint, and then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Overview page for SharePoint.](../media/m365-backup/backup-overview-page-sharepoint.png)

6. On the **Choose selection method** page, you can set up SharePoint sites using any or all three ways. A protection scope is the scope of user accounts within OneDrive that you want to protect with Microsoft 365 Backup.

    ![Screenshot of the Choose selection method page for SharePoint.](../media/m365-backup/backup-choose-selection-method-sharepoint.png)

    a. Under **Upload a list of sites in a CSV file**, you can upload a list of accounts to back up via a CSV file.

    The CSV upload feature for bulk addition of sites or user accounts in the backup policy creation workflow can accommodate a maximum of 50,000 entries per CSV file.

    b. Under **Back up sites that match specific filters**, you can select **Site name or URL contains** or **Site last modified**, or both.

    The rule-based feature for bulk addition of sites in the backup policy creation workflow allows you to add up to 10 site names or URLs at a time. Each keyword can have a minimum of three characters and maximum of 255 characters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The site last modified feature is in preview.

    c. Under **Select sites individually**, you can search and select sites you want to add to a backup policy.

7. Once you make the right selections, select **Next** to create the backup policy for SharePoint.

8. On the **Review SharePoint backup policy** page, review the information to make sure it's how you want it, and then select **Create policy** (or **Update policy** if it's an update).

    ![Screenshot of the Review SharePoint backup policy page.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-review-policy-sharepoint.png)

9. The backup policy for SharePoint is created.

    ![Screenshot of the SharePoint backup policy created page.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-created-sharepoint.png)

    Once the sites are added to a backup policy, it might take up to 15 minutes per 1,000 sites for restore points to become available for restore.

# [Exchange](#tab/exchange)

Follow these steps to set up a backup policy for Exchange mailboxes sites using Microsoft 365 Backup.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft 365 Backup** from the list of products.

4. On the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **Exchange** section, select **Set up policy**.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Backup page with Exchange highlighted.](../media/m365-backup/backup-setup-backup-page-exchange.png)

5. On the **Overview** page, review the backup policy attributes for Exchange, and then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Overview page for Exchange.](../media/m365-backup/backup-overview-page-exchange.png)

6. On the **Choose selection method** page, you can select shared or user mailboxes using any of the four available methods. Other Exchange recipient types, such as room mailboxes, aren't supported at this time. A protection scope is the scope of mailboxes within Exchange that you want to protect with Microsoft 365 Backup.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Adding a mailbox to the backup policy backs up the primary and archive mailboxes.
    >
    > Adding a mailbox might temporarily fail if the mailbox setup isn't yet complete. For example, if you recently created the user, licensed the user, or migrated the mailbox from on premises, you might see a transient failure while the mailbox is still being set up.

    ![Screenshot of the Choose selection method page for Exchange.](../media/m365-backup/backup-choose-selection-method-exchange.png)

    a. Under **Upload a list of mailboxes in a CSV file**, you can upload a list of accounts to back up via a CSV file.

    The CSV upload feature for bulk addition of mailboxes in the backup policy creation workflow can accommodate a maximum of 50,000 entries per CSV file.

    b. Under **Using a dynamic rule**, you can select **Distribution lists** or **Security groups**, or both. With dynamic rules, any changes to membership in the selected distribution lists and security groups are automatically reevaluated daily, ensuring the backup policy reflects those membership changes regularly.

    For example, if a user is added to a distribution list included in the dynamic rule, that user is included in the backup policy within a day. After that, Microsoft 365 Backup will create restore points for that user. If a user that was previously in the included distribution list is removed from that list, then they're removed from the backup policy within 24 hours. The user's existing backups remain restorable until they expire based on their retention period. However, new backups aren't taken until the user is re-added to the included distribution list or manually re-added through a static addition.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The dynamic rule feature is in preview.

    c. Under **Using filters**, you can select **Distribution lists** or **Security groups**, or both. The distribution list and security group are flattened when added, meaning the policy doesn't update dynamically if the groups or distribution list are updated later.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Members of security groups that are shared mailboxes are currently not added. You'll need to add shared mailboxes manually.
   
    The rule-based feature for bulk addition of mailboxes via security groups or distribution lists can accommodate a maximum of three groups at a time. These rules are static and applied one time only. That is, the security groups or distribution lists are flattened at the time of adding to the backup configuration policy. For example, groups or lists don't dynamically update in the system if users are added or removed from the original security group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The site last modified feature is in preview.

    d. Under **Select mailboxes individually**, you can search and select mailboxes you want to add to a backup policy.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Hybrid deployments, where a user's primary mailbox resides on premises while their archive is migrated to Exchange Online, aren't supported.

7. Once you make the right selections, select **Next** to create the backup policy for Exchange.

8. On the **Review Exchange backup policy** page, review the information to make sure it's how you want it, and then select **Create policy** (or **Update policy** if it's an update).

9. The backup policy for Exchange is created.

    ![Screenshot of the Exchange backup policy created page.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-created-exchange.png)

    Once the mailboxes are added to a backup policy, it might take up to 15 minutes per 1,000 mailboxes for restore points to become available for restore.

# [OneDrive](#tab/onedrive)

Follow these steps to set up a backup policy for OneDrive accounts using Microsoft 365 Backup.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft 365 Backup** from the list of products.

4. On the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, in the **OneDrive** section, select **Set up policy**.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Backup page with OneDrive highlighted.](../media/m365-backup/backup-setup-backup-page-onedrive.png)

5. On the **Overview** page, review the backup policy attributes for OneDrive, and then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Overview page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-overview-page-onedrive.png)

6. On the **Choose selection method** page, you can select OneDrive user accounts using any of the four available methods. A protection scope is the scope of user accounts within OneDrive that you want to protect with Microsoft 365 Backup.

    ![Screenshot of the Choose selection method page for OneDrive.](../media/m365-backup/backup-choose-selection-method-onedrive.png)

    a. Under **Upload a list of accounts in a CSV file**, you can upload a list of accounts to back up via a CSV file.

    The CSV upload feature for bulk addition of sites or user accounts in the backup policy creation workflow can accommodate a maximum of 50,000 entries per CSV file.

    b. Under **Using a dynamic rule**, you can select **Distribution lists** or **Security groups**, or both. With dynamic rules, any changes to membership in the selected distribution lists and security groups are automatically reevaluated daily, ensuring the backup policy reflects those membership changes regularly.

    For example, if a user is added to a distribution list included in the dynamic rule, that user is included in the backup policy within a day. After that, Microsoft 365 Backup will create restore points for that user. If a user that was previously in the included distribution list is removed from that list, then they're removed from the backup policy within 24 hours. The user's existing backups remain restorable until they expire based on their retention period. However, new backups aren't taken until the user is re-added to the included distribution list or manually re-added through a static addition.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The dynamic rule feature is in preview.

    c. Under **Using filters**, you can select **Distribution lists** or **Security groups**, or both. The distribution list and security group are flattened when added, meaning the policy doesn't update dynamically if the groups or distribution list members are updated later.

    The rule-based feature for bulk addition of user accounts via security groups or distribution lists can accommodate a maximum of three groups at a time. These rules are static and applied one time only. That is, the security groups or distribution lists are flattened at the time of adding to the backup configuration policy. For example, groups or lists aren't dynamically updated in the system if users are added or removed from the original security group.

    d. Under **Select accounts individually**, you can search and select accounts you want to add to a backup policy.

7. Once you make the right selections, select **Next** to create the backup policy for OneDrive.

8. On the **Review OneDrive backup policy** page, review the information to make sure it's how you want it, and then select **Create policy** (or **Update policy** if it's an update).

9. The backup policy for OneDrive is created.

    ![Screenshot of the OneDrive backup policy created page.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-created-onedrive.png)

    Once the sites are added to a backup policy, it might take 15 to 25 minutes per 1,000 sites for restore points to become available for restore.

## View and edit backup policies

You can edit the scope of OneDrive accounts, SharePoint sites, and Exchange mailboxes associated with a backup policy. As part of edit, you can either add new accounts, sites, or mailboxes to or remove them from backup. Removing accounts, sites, and mailboxes from Microsoft 365 Backup doesn't mean existing backups aren't deleted, rather it means additional backups aren't taken.

Select the **SharePoint**, **Exchange**, or **OneDrive** tab for steps to view and edit backup policies for that product.

# [SharePoint](#tab/sharepoint)

Follow these steps to view and edit backup policies in SharePoint.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, click on the **Backup policies** tab to view the list of all backup policies created in your organization. You may filter the list of policies by SharePoint **Service** to view the list of all SharePoint backup policies created in your organization. To edit any specific policy, select that policy and click on **View details.**

    ![Screenshot showing the view and edit backup policy for SharePoint in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-sharepoint.png)

1. On the policy specific panel, on the **Policy details** tab, in the **Scope** area, select **Edit**.

1. You can either add new sites to or remove sites from an existing SharePoint backup policy.

    a. To add new sites, on the **Included sites** tab, select **+ Add sites**.
   
       b. Select sites by any method as discussed in the creation section. Once you add sites to the list, follow the prompts to update the policy.

       ![Screenshot showing how to add sites to the existing SharePoint backup policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-sharepoint-add-site.png)

    c. To remove sites from existing SharePoint backup policy, on the **Included sites** tab, select the relevant sites, and then select **Remove**. Once you're done with your changes, follow the prompts to remove the sites. The removed sites are moved to the **Removed Items** tab under the **Backup policies** tab.
   
       ![Screenshot showing how to remove sites from SharePoint backup policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-remove-site.png)

4. Once you make your changes, follow the prompts to update the policy.

    ![Screenshot of the updated SharePoint sites backup policy panel in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-updated-sites.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Removing sites from backup policy means no future backups are taken for those removed sites. Existing backups for the removed sites aren't deleted and will be charged.

# [Exchange](#tab/exchange)

Follow these steps to view and edit backup policies for Exchange.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the **Microsoft 365 Backup** page, click on the **Backup policies** tab to view the list of all backup policies created in your organization. You may filter the list of policies by Exchange **Service** to view the list of all Exchange Online backup policies created in your organization. To edit any specific policy, select that policy and click on **View details**.

<!---

1. You can either add new mailboxes to or remove mailboxes from the existing Exchange backup policy.

    a. To add new shared or user mailboxes, use the following method:
   
   - On the policy specific panel, on the **Policy details** tab, in the **Scope** area, select **Edit**.
      
   - To add new sites, on the **Included sites** tab, select **+ Add sites**.
      
   - Select the mailboxes by using any of the four available methods as discussed in the creation section. Once you add mailboxes to the list, follow the prompts to update the policy.
   
    ![Screenshot showing how to add mailboxes to the existing Exchange backup policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-exchange-add-mailbox.png)
   
       b. To remove user mailboxes from existing backup policy, on the **Included mailboxes** tab, select the user mailboxes from the list, and select **Remove**.

       Mailboxes added to a backup policy through a dynamic rule can't be individually removed. To exclude these mailboxes from the backup policy, you must modify the rule conditions. For example, if User A is part of Distribution List P, removing User A from the list excludes them from the policy. Alternatively, removing the entire distribution list from the rule removes all mailboxes that were added through that list from the backup policy.

       ![Screenshot showing how to remove user mailboxes from Exchange backup policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](../media/m365-backup/backup-policy-remove-mailbox.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Removing accounts from backup policy means no future backups are taken for those removed accounts. Existing backups for those accounts aren't deleted and will be charged.
   
---

## Delete a dynamic rule

When deleting a dynamic rule, you have two options that determine how existing accounts are treated in the backup policy.

#### Delete rule but continue backups

The dynamic rule is converted into a static list. Backup continues for all user accounts that were included through the rule at the time of deletion. However, future changes to the original distribution lists or security groups—such as users being added or removed—are no longer reflected in the backup policy. For example, if a user is added to a previously included group after the rule is deleted, they aren't automatically added to the backup policy.

#### Delete rule and stop new backups

The dynamic rule is removed, and no new backups are taken for accounts previously included through the rule. Existing backups for these users remain restorable until they expire based on the configured retention period. You can re-enable backup for these users by manually adding them or by creating a new dynamic rule that includes them.

## States of backup

|States  |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|Active     | Protection scope selected under backup policy is being actively backed up. |
|Paused     | No further backups are taken but already taken backups are preserved. |
|Not set up | No backup policy is set up for this scope.  |
|Processing | A change to backup policy or a restore is in progress.  |

## Multi-geo environments

Microsoft 365 Backup supports the backup of sites and user accounts from both the central and satellite locations if the multi-geo feature is enabled on your tenant. This means that you can add the sites or user accounts from all geos while creating the backup configuration policy via the CSV file upload method. Adding sites via the site picker, search, or filter rules don't currently support multi-geo. The user interface experiences today only support addition of sites in the tenant's central location.

Most importantly, data in the backups honor the multi-geo residency requirements and keep data in the geo you define for it to live.
